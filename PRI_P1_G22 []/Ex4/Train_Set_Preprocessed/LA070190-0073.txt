tetsuya theodore fujita saw his only natural tornado near denver in it was like meeting my lover he says since then my passion really went up said fujita a professor of geophysical science who has been studying tornadoes for years and is considered one of the world s foremost authorities on the violent storms fujita spends much of his time in his lab at the university of chicago creating tornadoes for research he creates tornadoes over a large fan which makes a swirling motion another fan above simulates a low pressure system by adding an updraft to the mix with a bit of steam added to make the phenomenon visible he creates twisters six to eight feet tall the miniature versions are as impossible to redirect or squelch as their full size cousins he says he has tried by crawling right up next to them and using rulers or books to change their direction fujita came to the united states from japan in partly because there are so many tornadoes in this country tornadoes are very rare in japan fujita said they have about to a year but one occurred within about miles of my hometown i was quite impressed with the localized severity of the wind when he saw his first tornado he and a team of scientists were studying wind shear and its effect on aircraft it s a beautiful thing fujita said of course i was miles away from that one if you re in it he added it s a terrible thing forecasters still have trouble predicting tornadoes but fujita has helped define the conditions most likely to spawn them groups of thunderstorms are not as likely to spawn tornadoes as single large storms because multiple storms in the same area compete each one tries to rotate but they all ca n t they re just like human beings the rich may become richer and the poor may get poorer fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters he calls suction vortices rotating around the center of a larger tornado a suction vortex can pick up a car or a small house or something but when you re standing right next to it you can be completely safe he has studied tornadoes that have dropped houses into lakes made off with one car and left another right next to it untouched and moved whole flocks of cows and sheep which lived through the experience he also developed the fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes it runs from zero a tornado that might break twigs on trees to five a twister that can rip houses from their foundations but fujita considers his work on other air movements called downbursts and microbursts among his most significant achievements downbursts are powerful drafts of air moving down from a thunderstorm cloud scientists long thought the drafts dissipated before reaching the ground microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts but are more dangerous because they give pilots less time to react fujita said the national transportation safety board has cited microbursts a term coined by fujita as the cause of aircraft accidents in the last years causing fatalities among them was the crash of a delta l in dallas that killed people a downburst also was implicated in the collapse of a wall at a school in newburgh n y that killed nine children fujita s work helped persuade the federal aviation administation to begin installing a new radar system at major airports beginning in the early s the doppler radar system was credited with helping three jetliners at denver s airport avoid potentially catastrophic microbursts last year fujita retires from teaching this year but will continue his research at the university in texas one time five people were killed when they drove right into a tornado they just did n t know any better fujita said i want to make people safer
