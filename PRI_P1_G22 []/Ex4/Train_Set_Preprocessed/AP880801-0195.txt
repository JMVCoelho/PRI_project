a split charred tree stump is a clue that lightning was to blame for a forest fire carbon particles indicate the exhaust of a passing truck was the culprit and there are other ways to tell a fire was accidental you eliminate all those causes you re down to arson said dale smallwood a criminal investigator for missouri s mark twain national forest he comes down to arson in most of his investigations _ and he and other forest officials believe the problem is often rooted in some regional traditions that are as hard to quell as flames a psychologist s study found economic and even aesthetic reasons why some people light woods aflame arsonists set of the mark twain fires that have broken out so far this year burning more than acres smallwood said a total of acres of the forest which covers million acres mostly in southern missouri were burned during a spring fire season made more volatile by drought on average smallwood estimates percent of the forest fires each year in missouri are deliberately set it s probably percent higher than the national average said ron mcdonald mark twain s fire control officer he said mark twain consistently is among the five forest districts with the worst arson problem it s just been an ozark tradition of incendiary lrb deliberately set rrb fires mcdonald said the tradition seems to stretch across the southern united states according to smallwood fires in other areas are more likely to be caused by lightning or man s carelessness as one of the forest service s special law enforcement agents smallwood has spent most of the past years investigating fires in the forests he loves i consider myself an ozark hillbilly he said the forest service is charged with protecting wildlands and balancing recreational needs with commercial interests in timber and mineral resources smallwood s job includes investigating marijuana growing in the forest timber theft and theft of other federal property his military neat office at the forest service headquarters in rolla is decorated with game bird feathers a picture of smokey bear and a glass doored bookcase lined with reports and text books the forest service has called on psychologists sociologists and archaeologists to determine why fires are set part of it is tradition smallwood said in the springtime people used to burn the woods to allow grass to grow a policy of open grazing with cattle free to feed on any unfenced land was allowed in the ozarks until the s longer than in other wooded areas smallwood said psychologist john p shea in the s conducted one of the first forest service studies of arson subsistence farmers in the rural south who were interviewed by shea and his researchers claimed fire helped control ticks snakes and disease and controlled the encroachment of trees on land where they wanted to graze cattle their ways are those of frontiersmen living in an arrested frontier shea wrote aesthetics even played a part shea and other researchers found that people living in areas where arson was common enjoyed the smell of smoke in the spring air and believed the woods looked better burned clean the forest service has attempted to counter the lore that can lead to burning over the years timber has been touted as a cash crop that is as worthy of protection as grassland smokey bear and other programs encourage the view of the forests as a priceless national resource but the tradition of using fire to manage the woods dies hard there s no cut and dried way to prevent it mcdonald said we had one case lrb in rrb where two men went to sunday school and after school they started a fire with their sunday school literature smallwood said they just happened to be driving through an area they thought needed to be burned out still the arsonist does not always fit the profile of a simply misguided citizen part of the problem is people driving around drinking and shooting road signs smallwood said when they get bored with that they set fires it s malicious mischief sometimes you hear that someone is angry at the forest service because of some administrative action _ because we closed a road or disallowed something and they do n t necessarily have to be mad at the forest service they could be mad at government period then fire is used as retaliation it s so senseless he said it just costs a lot of money to put these fires out and it s coming right out of our tax dollars mcdonald who oversees about mark twain employees trained as firefighters said forest fires cost to an acre to suppress in the rare case of a conviction the arsonist is likely to be put on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fire and replacing timber that was destroyed smallwood said last year a judge ordered two arsonists to work weekends for the forest service an arson case in the forest is very hard to make he said when you go out in the middle of the forest to a blackened area to begin an investigation it s very difficult and frustrating no you usually do n t have any witnesses he noted that in some cases people who have evidence withhold it for fear of being burned out themselves beyond the cost in dollars of forest fires there s risk to those who fight them we had an employee die of a heart attack fighting an arson fire smallwood said referring to a blaze we would have liked to have prosecuted someone in that case and i would have also liked to have known if the prosecutor would have considered a manslaughter charge against the arsonist
