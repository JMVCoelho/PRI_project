summary a lengthy statement attributed to the imprisoned shining path leadership published recently in a leading opposition newspaper provides what appears to be a strategic rationale for the peace proposal made by the insurgents last fall while the newspaper has accepted the document as an authentic call for peace by the shining path the paper has also stressed that the peace called for in the statement is nothing more than a temporary tactical retreat by the shining path leaders and is not as president alberto fujimori has contended an implicit admission of defeat end summary although la republica a prominent anti fujimori daily provided little information on the origins of the important and unusual document that it published in a special january supplement it assured its readers that the lengthy ideological tract explaining the shining path s struggle for a peace agreement was a genuine shining path statement the paper claimed that the anonymous sources who supplied the secret document provided full authentication and that experts consulted by the paper also agreed that the document was the handiwork of imprisoned shining path leader abimael guzman lrb la republica january rrb lrb see note rrb lrb note rrb la republica did not assert that the document was actually signed by guzman however the paper did claim that the document was approved by imprisoned shining path central committee members elena iparraguirre revoredo osman morote barrionuevo marta huatay ruiz maria pantoja sanchez and rosa angelica salas de la cruz lrb january rrb while the anti fujimori daily may have at least in part published the document to discredit president fujimori it contended that it was motivated by a desire to provide peruvians with information on the peace proposal that had not been made available by the government the paper declared that it was clearly its duty to publish the document given the mantle of silence that the government has cast over the peace negotiations lrb january rrb la republica s publication of the shining path strategy statement follows by three months the october release by the fujimori government of letters from guzman calling for peace talks with the government lrb radio programs del peru october radio and tv october global de television october panamericana television october rrb the shining path leadership s sudden willingness to pursue peace talks with the government just as the october national referendum vote was approaching raised questions in the media about whether the letters really represented authoritative shining path policy lsb see box rsb lrb see note rrb lrb note rrb among other objectives the narrowly successful referendum was designed to allow the president to serve a second successive term tactical retreat for guzman implicitly rejecting fujimori s claim that the shining path s call for a negotiated peace represented an admission of political defeat by the insurgents la republica concluded that the movement s leadership saw its call for peace as nothing more than a temporary ceasefire lrb january rrb lrb see note rrb according to the daily s january editorial the shining path tract makes it clear that in the eyes of abimael guzman a peace agreement is simply an armed truce until after the year ooo at which time the shining path would resume its bloodbath la republica offered a possible explanation for the insurgents tactical retreat in a o january interview with a military and subversion analyst who suggested that a temporary withdrawal may offer guzman an opportunity to preserve his authority as political leader despite the obvious limitations of beings imprisoned thee analyst concluded therefore that the insurgents peace strategy represents an ideological reaffirmation of guzman s leadership and recognition that circumstances have changed lrb note rrb for example in his presentation of the video recording of guzman s first call for peace talks fujimori claimed that the shining path political leadership has tacitly admitted that the peruvian state has totally recovered the initiative in confronting the shining path lrb lima radio and tv october rrb outlook la republica s assessment of the shining path peace strategy document may quiet doubts about whether earlier letters calling for peace talks actually represented the views of top leaders at the same time however by concluding that the published strategy statement is merely the shining path s declaration of temporary retreat the daily has raised new questions about the credibility of fujimori s claim that the call for peace represents a victory for the government while such doubts are unlikely to seriously affect fujimori s prospects for reelection next year they may have further tarnished the

political observer had warned that guzman s reported desire to reach a peace agreement does not mean there is reason to claim a victory in the ongoing struggle against terrorism since according to the observer the imprisoned insurgent leader may no longer control the shining path lrb october rrb following the second guzman letter which supplemented the call for peace talks with what seemed to be praise for fujimori s economic and political program lrb lima global de television o october rrb a commentator for the anti fujimori weekly caretas wrote that the government was using a broken guzman in the campaign for the yes vote for the upcoming referendum adding that it is no coincidence that the letters have come out during the o days prior to the october vote lrb october rrb responding similarly to the second guzman letter an editorial in la republica wondered whether government representatives working to promote the yes vote on the referendum had not fallen into a trap by thinking that shining path militants would take seriously such an unctuous call for peace talks as appeared in the letter lrb october rrb also in response to the second letter caretas on october claimed that fujimori was using guzman in the campaign to win the october referendum noting that with guzman s letters calling for peace talks fujimori s promise to wipe out the shining path by may gain
