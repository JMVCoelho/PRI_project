bank of boston corp s decision to treat its third world loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions bankers and analysts say domestically the move reflects the competitive advantage that regional banks with large loan loss reserves have over their big brothers in such money centers as new york chicago and san francisco internationally it appears that it will be even more difficult for economically troubled developing nations to attract new bank loans u s banks are increasingly splitting into two groups on one hand there is a small group of money center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries on the other hand is a group of regional institutions which with relatively small exposure to developing countries are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or as bank of boston decided monday to completely write off some loans as uncollectible it s a parting of the ways between the money centers who are out to collect on their assets and the regionals who want to get out says lawrence cohn an analyst at merrill lynch co the bank of boston decision may well drive a wedge between the money center banks and the regional banks adds james j mcdermott jr director of research at keefe bruyette woods inc a securities firm which specializes in bank stocks it s created an enormous quandary for many money center banks mr mcdermott says actions such as that taken by bank of boston highlight a potential competitive edge that regional banks have over money center banks management could use their reserve position to emphasize stength when competing for deposits and banking business against larger banks the reserve action also could make it easier for institutions like bank of boston to attract investors to their stock and other securities bank analysts said while the large banks are eager to remain competitive with such regionals as bank of boston they also want to ensure that the regionals continue to lend to heavily indebted developing nations earlier this year bank of boston proved one of the more difficult regionals to corral into a billion bank loan for mexico according to new york bankers now that bank of boston has reserved and written off most of its loans to less developed countries it s likely to be much less willing to join any such new efforts that could add to the lending burden for the biggest u s banks moreover most of the nation s big banks could n t afford to follow bank of boston s lead without crippling their capital and reducing their common equity asset ratios to unacceptably low levels for instance if manufacturers hanover corp imitated bank of boston s action it would have to add billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only keefe bruyette estimates in order to take steps similar to bank of boston s large money center banks would have to sell assets shrink balance sheets and slash dividends and they show little sign of doing that yesterday manufacturers hanover announced a regular quarterly dividend of cents a share offering investors a yield of more than annually manufacturers hanover declined to comment on whether it might follow bank of boston s action other large new york banks also declined to disclose their plans although a spokeman for chase manhattan corp said we re obviously looking at it mellon bank corp said yesterday that it expects a fourth quarter loss of about million and that it would increase loan loss reserves by about million to cover troubled foreign loans the stocks of several major money center banks fell sharply yesterday in new york stock exchange composite trading chase manhattan skidded to close at manufacturers hanover fell to and j p morgan co was off to bank of boston closed up cents at while mellon fell to analysts expect that other regional banks may copy the action taken by bank of boston i would n t be surprised if some of the medium sized regionals decided to follow said cheryl swaim an analyst and vice president at oppenheimer co in boston there were rumors bank of new england might announce a similar move but a company spokesman said reserve levels are appropriate bank of boston announced monday that it was writing off million of loans to less developed countries and that it was placing all but a small portion of its loans to the third world on a non accrual basis when a loan is placed on non accrual a bank only credits interest it actually receives and does n t automatically accrue interest due bank of boston also placed on non accrual million in loans to less developed countries that are unrelated to trade along with million in such loans previously put on non accrual bank of boston has now either charged off or put on non accrual all of its billion loans to heavily indebted developing countries this does n t include million in trade related debt while bank of boston s action is the most striking to date to remove latin exposure from its balance sheet smaller similar actions began at other banks around mid year first bank system inc minneapolis the nation s th biggest banking concern charged off million in troubled foreign loans during the third quarter first chicago corp the th largest banking concern charged off million in third world loans during the quarter and even before the big reserves were set aside banks were quietly charging off latin debt though on a smaller scale last march continental illinois corp said it had charged off about half of its million of loans to peru
