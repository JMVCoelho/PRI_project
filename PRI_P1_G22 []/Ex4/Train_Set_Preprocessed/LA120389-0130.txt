the names will be different but more hurricanes with the powerful punches of hugo and gilbert may be prowling the atlantic caribbean and gulf of mexico in the future the probability of more intense hurricanes in the atlantic region is greater in the next decade or two than it has been in the s and s says meteorologist william m gray of colorado state university who analyzes hurricane patterns gray predicts a possible return of the more ferocious hurricanes of the s and s because of an apparent break in the periodic west african drought rainfall in the sahel typically associated with more intense hurricane activity was above average in for the first time since he says a second rainy summer this year indicates an end to the drought the most intense hurricanes gray explains usually form at low latitudes from tropical disturbances moving westward from africa the well watered conditions in the s and s produced of the most severe kind lrb categories and rrb in the year period to hurricanes are classified by the saffir simpson scale the fiercest a no or catastrophic storm the atmospheric pressure at its center drops drastically and its wind speed exceeds m p h in the drier year period of to there were only severe storms in the and seasons june through november there have been five last year s gilbert which left a wide swath of devastation across jamaica and the mexican yucatan was the mightiest hurricane on record in the western hemisphere its atmospheric pressure dropped to millibars and its wind speed reached m p h this september s hugo which ripped through the virgin islands and puerto rico before clobbering south carolina had sustained winds of m p h and an atmospheric pressure of millibars lrb inches rrb officially a on the saffir simpson scale it may be a borderline says meteorologist mark zimmer of the national hurricane center in miami the strongest recorded storm on earth zimmer says was typhoon tip in the western pacific with a low pressure of millibars outside the atlantic area and the eastern pacific hurricanes are called typhoons or cyclones fortunately most atlantic region hurricanes do not develop to their worst potential in this century only two no hurricanes have struck the united states with full force the labor day storm that ravaged the florida keys and s camille which slammed ashore at mississippi and louisiana in allen the mightiest caribbean storm then recorded had lost much of its punch before it hit the gulf coast of texas if the future is like the past with its pattern of atmospheric conditions there is a good probability of the return of stronger storms gray said but in the s he warns u s destruction will be at least four to five times more costly than in the s and s because of the boom in population and property development along coastal areas the threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any yet recorded says meteorologist kerry emanuel of the massachusetts institute of technology hurricanes are like huge self sustaining heat engines spinning across the sea they get their power from the water s warmth to develop they need tropical ocean surface temperatures of about degrees fahrenheit if tropical ocean temperatures go up the intensity of hurricanes will emanuel explains sea surface temperatures set the upper limits the biggest uncertainty he says is whether global warming will affect tropical ocean temperatures the gradual warming of the earth results from the greenhouse effect caused primarily by the accumulation of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere which like the glass of a greenhouse trap heat
