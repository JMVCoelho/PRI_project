it is ironic that there is an unprecedented greedy rush for diamonds by miners in angola and canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is in turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the world s most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market in canada s northwest territories the discovery of small diamonds some of gem quality has sparked the biggest rush to stake mining claims in the history of the north american industry stakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large and prospectors have claimed every piece of land within km lrb miles rrb of the discovery in spite of all this hectic activity it is very unlikely that anyone will find enough big diamonds to make the development of canada s first diamond mine worthwhile the odds in favour of making a fortune are much better for the diamond hunters in angola more than dollars m worth of gem diamonds a day are being smuggled out of that country for sale in antwerp an estimated private enterprise diggers are at work already and their numbers are being swelled by a day this rise of illegal mining particularly in the cuango region which produces per cent of angola s diamonds and some of its highest quality gem stones started in may after the peace accord which allowed freedom of movement for the first time in years as well as experienced miners many soldiers who could not find civilian jobs have made their way to the diamond areas the onset of the dry season and the fall in river levels from the end of may this year has encouraged what de beers the south african group that dominates the world diamond business describes as a sudden and unprecedented explosion in the supply of illicit angolan diamonds reaching the market even though there are so many diggers at work questions are being asked about whether there might be more to this explosion did unita angola s rebel movement build up a stockpile which is now being released is endiama angola s state owned diamond company implicated in some way in the murky world of diamond dealing such rumours abound de beers probably knows the answers because its intelligence network is remarkable what is also remarkable is that all those scrambling for diamonds in angola or dropping out of the skies to stake expensive claims in canada take it for granted that the diamond cartel will be able to continue to keep prices up and make all their efforts worthwhile the cartel has survived partly because nobody needs diamonds they are composed of very hard carbon so they can be useful for drilling holes in tough material but there are substitutes for this use gem diamonds are solely for decoration and serve no useful purpose but the cartel has ensured that rough lrb uncut rrb diamond prices have risen steadily since the s even when in the depths of the recession the price of a top quality one carat gem diamond slumped in the retail market from dollars to dollars the cartel is organised by de beers london based central selling organisation which markets about per cent of the world s rough diamonds apart from de beers own production from namibia and south africa the cso handles rough gem diamonds from angola australia botswana russia tanzania and zaire the cso has been mopping up as many of the smuggled angolan diamonds as possible to stop havoc being created in a business already suffering severely from soggy demand in the us and japan the two biggest markets which share about two thirds of demand between them de beers says that because times are tough it will probably have to cut its annual dividend payment for the first time since it has also told the producers to cut deliveries by per cent something the cso contracts permit at times of stress de beers releases a controlled stream of rough diamonds to the market through sights offered by the cso ten times a year to about selected buyers they are offered boxes of diamonds each worth between dollars and dollars m the contents are judged by the cso to balance the requirements of the buyers with market demand buyers have either to accept all the diamonds or reject the box mr harry oppenheimer whose family effectively controls both de beers and its sister group the anglo american corporation of south africa was defending the cartel again last week at the formal opening of the r bn venetia diamond mine in the transvaal the cso does not and could not run a monopolistic system he said in bad times like this i sometimes wish that we could the fact is that the level of world diamond production which is carried on in many countries can not be controlled diamond prices can not be fixed artificially but have to be set at a level which allows production and consumption to be equated what the cso for many years has done successfully is to operate a buffer pool stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating its stocks when demand is in excess of the level of supply in this way it has been able to preserve an essential degree of stability in the price of this ultimate luxury of gem diamonds to the common advantage of producers processors and consumers of this unique natural product all very altruistic but de beers makes huge profits from its diamond business a record dollars bn in and more than dollars bn last year the cartel nearly lost control of the market in the early s it was a time of galloping inflation a weak dollar and low interest rates merchants particularly in israel stockpiled diamonds on borrowed money as a hedge against inflation and when recession hit they had to dump diamonds faster than the central selling organisation could mop them up the cso s diamond stocks worth under dollars bn in rose to dollars bn by hundreds of diamond investment trusts and traders were bankrupted at that time and australia and zaire challenged de beers near monopoly de beers has taken good care that merchant stocks have never again been built for speculative reasons frequently going to the banks the potential financiers of stockpiling operations to educate them about the way the diamond market works after the bust came boom diamond sales in value terms jumped by per cent in and another per cent the following year to cool the market the cso imposed swingeing price increases per cent in may and per cent in march underlying the boom was phenomenal growth in demand for diamonds in japan where lack of living space encourages people to display their wealth by buying small but expensive items the cso boosted the trend with clever promotion so that today diamond engagement rings are regularly exchanged in japan whereas forthcoming marriages traditionally were celebrated over a cup of rice wine it must be open to question whether another japan can be found to lift the diamond market as the present recession ends but in the meantime mr julian ogilvie thompson de beers chairman insists that the cso s control of the diamond market is not slipping by mopping up angolan supplies we can say that more of the world s rough diamonds are passing through the cso than ever before he says by applying the deferred purchases clauses in our contracts with producers we are applying the right medicine to ensure that demand matches supply and that the diamond market will remain stable the future of de beers diamond operations in namibia were discussed with the government there yesterday in the past there have been suggestions that cdm de beers wholly owned subsidiary might be at least partly nationalised cdm has diamond mining operations over a coastal area extending km north of the orange river and recently brought the auchas and elizabeth bay mines into production last year namibian output reached m carats up from rough diamond production lrb million carats rrb
