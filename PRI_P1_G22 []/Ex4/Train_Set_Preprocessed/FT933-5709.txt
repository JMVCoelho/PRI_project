the man president bill clinton has chosen to head the task force to help get his free trade pact with canada and mexico ratified may lack experience in international trade arenas but he comes to washington well prepared for the kind of back room political arm twisting that will be required to persuade a divided congress to pass it william daley is younger brother and chief adviser to chicago s mayor richard m daley and offspring of the legendary democratic machine boss the late richard j daley unlike his hot tempered and very public brother year old bill daley is a smooth talking behind the scenes operator with important connections in washington and long standing ties with organised labour he has never run for political office mr daley accepted the nafta position after being passed over for a cabinet position and turning down an offer to be mr clinton s chief negotiator at the general agreement on tariffs and trade in geneva he chaired mr clinton s election campaign in illinois where he delivered per cent of the vote to clinton above the national average and continues as a tangible supporter most recently he arranged a posh chicago dinner for the president that raised dollars m lrb pounds rrb however mr daley s appointment to chair the white house s task force on the north america free trade agreement is not a cosy political payoff recent polls show that as many as two thirds of the american people do not support nafta and grassroots opposition fuelled by labour groups is growing mr clinton himself reserved his support for the deal negotiated under george bush s administration until side agreements dealing with environmental and labour issues were reached last month many democrats in congress including some in the powerful illinois delegation are uncommitted with the agreement fated to unravel if it is not ratified by january the battle for congressional support will be fierce fast and visible mr daley was chosen for the job chicago observers say because he has proven he can sway votes and is willing to take the risk of losing a controversial battle bill daley is no washington neophyte clinton needs someone with political sense to move this thing through congress and daley has the connections says a fellow washington lobbyist opposition to nafta comes from core democratic constituencies making it a potential political pothole for mr clinton mr daley s talents have been summoned insiders say to convince moderate democrats to back the agreement the president needs votes in the house to ratify nafta the administration counts republicans in favour of the agreement clinton ally and fellow chicago democrat mr dan rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means committee is expected to deliver the democrats on his committee however mr rostenkowski is under investigation for improper use of his post office perks and faces an uneasy future by rough count mr daley will have to marshall votes from democratic representatives of states standing to gain the most from the agreement those along the border with mexico and those with big agricultural consumer product or manufacturing export interests his chicago style back room muscle will be an invisible counterweight to the public tactics of nafta s most prominent opponent mr ross perot mr perot s populist anti nafta campaign touts the giant sucking sound that will be heard as nafta loosened jobs flow south of the texas border it is a very interesting juxtaposition of styles says chicago political commentator mr bruce dumont bill daley is like a stealth bomber you may not see him but you ll see the results mr daley has taken four months out from his chicago law firm to lead the nafta push he recently rejoined the firm after a three year stint as president of the amalgamated bank of chicago which was founded by the amalgamated textile workers union in although it passed into private ownership in its board is still dominated by high profile union officials mr clinton may be banking on mr daley s union ties to help the nafta effort however mr daley by pushing nafta runs the risk of alienating his union supporters mr jim jontz former congressman from indiana and director of the anti nafta citizen s trade campaign said i do n t know why bill daley would want to be in a position like that it s just wrong
