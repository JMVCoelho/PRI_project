turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at venetia de beers newest diamond mine km from south africa s borders with botswana and zimbabwe only weeks before the mine came into production in july at a cost of usdollars m de beers central selling organisation which controls per cent of world trade in rough lrb uncut rrb diamonds imposed quotas on its producer suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from angola for a time venetia the first mine of any sort in south africa to gain permission for seven day working moved to a five day week this year it has gone back to seven day working as the quotas were eased so that the cso is now accepting per cent of the diamonds it contracted to take from producers however there is still turmoil in the diamond market caused by uncertainty about russian exports following leaks of stones from that country outside its contract with the cso consequently mr hans gastrow general manager says that this year venetia will process m tonnes of ore per cent below its capacity it is also mining an area of lower grade ore which has fewer diamonds in each tonne mr gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be well below the m carats a year de beers predicted venetia would yield at full production last year the mine building up rapidly more than doubled output and processed m tonnes of ore to recover m carats about per cent of venetia s diamonds are of gem quality and analysts suggest that at dollars a carat on average the mine is generating annual sales of about dollars m mr gastrow says that apart from the imposition of the cso quota venetia has made a remarkably smooth transition from construction to production this year will be a time of consolidation he insists that the quota is having no impact on employment nevertheless venetia originally was to have employed and it now has a mine of venetia s size in the past would have employed the total has been kept down here partly by highly automated process plant but also by fewer people employed just to see that other people are doing their jobs according to mr david gadd claxton ore extraction manager venetia was the first new south african diamond mine for years it is also the country s biggest diamond mine and a major contributor of export earnings the mine has also revitalised de beers production as it is accounting for half the group s output in south africa and replacing production from its year old kimberley mines which are now fading away venetia s success is strategically important to de beers because when its output is added to that in botswana and namibia it gives the group direct control over more than per cent of world rough gem diamond output this provides a major base for the cso to work from and gives it a powerful position from which to negotiate with other producers in the diamond cartel and while venetia is using conventional methods to mine about m tonnes of waste and to mine and process m tonnes of ore over its projected year life it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labour relations and environmental issues at least as far as south africa is concerned for example there are no migrant workers at the mine employees are bussed in from nearby towns for hour shifts and then return to their families venetia is also breaking with the de beers tradition that for security reasons no equipment leaves the mine but is burried within the top security area once it is no longer useful here worn out equipment will be stockpiled and sold off when the mine closes it could be worth millions of dollars
