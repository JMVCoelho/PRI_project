a colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the english channel from the white cliffs of dover pursuing a dream born in napoleon s time that is coming true at last another is digging from the french coast in what the tunnel builders call the largest civil engineering project now under way in the world the mile tunnel miles of it underwater will cut the london paris journey from six hours to three as fast as a scheduled airline it will enable freight to travel on one train instead of being shifted to trucks for a cross channel ferry trip subject to weather and shipping strikes tunneling speed at the dover end is less than feet an hour and the machine boring from the geologically more complex french end moves even slower which is why the tunnel will not open until for continental europeans accustomed to long distance rail travel the tunnel is but a small spur on a vast network stretching to moscow and beyond for the british the change wrought by what many call the chunnel will be enormous some wonder whether britain will be ready for it people still question whether the tunnel will be complete in may and that s ridiculous says kathy watson co author of a book on the project they re still arguing about whether it will introduce rabies into this country or let in terrorists they discuss it in terms of their being an island race with a channel that has kept out invaders she said in an interview state owned british rail will not commit itself to building a high speed link from london to the tunnel in time to make the three hour journey a reality in it intends instead to improve existing tracks eurotunnel the anglo french consortium that will own the tunnel is urging british rail to speed its plans critics say the tangle of commuter lines in southeast england so obsolete that trains can be delayed by a sudden fall of autumn leaves will delay tunnel traffic the consortium forecasts million passengers in but the railroad says that figure will not be reached before arriving channel trains will terminate at waterloo station in south london at a large customs and immigration terminal critics say this will waste time and britain should follow the continental practice of handling such matters on the train during the journey british stations bridges and tunnels are not built for the tall loads commonly carried across the channel that means many loads will have to be repacked or transferred to trucks unless the facilities are rebuilt the grandiose project has been on and off the drawing boards for more than years napoleon wanted to bore a tunnel in but britain s generals warned him off digging began in but was halted by british fears of french invasion through the tunnel britain s entry into the european economic community engendered a spirit of unity and the digging began again in but two years later a new british government shelved the project with trade barriers among the eec countries set to fall in colin kirkland technical director of eurotunnel s on the british side says the tunnel will be completed this time he says the entire cost of billion pound lrb billion rrb project is privately financed and cancellation would cost the governments enormous penalties to shareholders also the governments signed a tunnel treaty in february and both would have to agree to cancellation there s no way that politicians will cancel this project kirkland said in an interview it s quite difficult to get one government to agree to get two is bloody nigh impossible money s power to move the tunnel forward was demonstrated in august when drilling fell behind schedule eurotunnel ordered a management shakeup and threatened trans manche link the consortium of british and french engineering companies building the tunnel with penalties of million if the diggers did not pass the three mile mark by nov from a a rate of feet a week the pace quickly accelerated and recently achieved a week s record of feet kirkland said the timetable calls for feet a week and kirkland is confident of reaching it the tunnel feet below the seabed was miles into the channel from this end oct the most recent measurement available and the french had progressed about feet digging began last december at its peak the project will employ about workers and tunneling machines construction of the two one way train tunnels begins in december a smaller service tunnel running between them now is being dug tunneling machines simultaneously dig remove rock and put up tunnel walls with a laser beam to keep the driver on course the foot long behemoth creeps along pressing curved slabs of scottish granite and pulverized ash into the newly exposed tunnel wall in an emergency like flooding the cylindrical head of the machine can expand to become a cork blocking off the water and spraying concrete into the cavity to seal the leak once the all clear is given the two story high rotating blade with its tungsten teeth resumes chewing ahead because the machines are too large to be removed when the digging is complete they will be rolled aside and walled in the tunnels are to be completed in then the railroad tracks will be laid eurotunnel will run shuttle trains once every three minutes at peak times between terminals near folkestone and calais and british rail and the frenh state railroad will operate trains from london and paris cars and trucks will drive onto the shuttle trains and be able to stay in their vehicles or stroll about during the minute tunnel passage
