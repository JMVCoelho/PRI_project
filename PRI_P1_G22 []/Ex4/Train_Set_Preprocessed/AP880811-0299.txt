an annual agriculture department survey confirmed thursday that a deadening drought will curtail the fall corn harvest by a third or more resulting in higher retail food prices for months and years to come however government officials said bountiful crops in recent years has built stockpiles so high the united states need not fear actual shortages on grocery shelves and can even continue exporting food the report came hours after president reagan signed a billion relief bill that he acknowledged wo n t bring rain to crops already sweltering but hopefully will help farmers survive to plant again next spring the new surveys led usda experts to predict the corn crop will total billion bushels down percent from last year s harvest and the smallest output since sharp reductions also were reported for soybeans wheat and a number of other crops cotton which thrived last month in the hot humid weather is expected to increase from last year overall the department s agricultural statistics board put total u s crop production at percent of the average a scale used to compare output from year to year that matched the low reading when sharp cutbacks in government acreage programs along with drought reduced crop production sharply the corn crop is expected to average bushels per harvested acre down from bushel per acre last year a record year to year decline of percent corn is the largest and most important crop grown by american farmers and as a feed ingredient is essential to the production of meat poultry and dairy products assistant secretary ewen m wilson the department s chief economist said the drought may add percent to the cost of food this year percent next year today s reports confirm that the drought has had a major impact on this year s crops wilson told reporters but because of large pre season stocks total supplies are enough in most cases to assure and adequate food supply at home satisfy foreign customers and meet our food aid commitments sen patrick j leahy d vt chairman of the senate agriculture committee said in a statement today s crop report confirms our fears about the impacts of this summer s tragic drought fortunately it appears we will have enough stocks to make it through this marketing year the usda s grim news came hours after president reagan on thursday signed a billion disaster relief bill aimed at helping drought stricken farmers recover this bill is n t as good as rain reagan said to the nation s farmers but it will tide you over until normal weather and your own skills permit you to return to your accustomed role the new usda crop estimates were based on field surveys as of aug in may and june before drought had made its biggest impact usda projected the corn harvest _ based on trends and an assumption of normal weather _ at billion bushels but those projections were revised downward a month ago to billion bushels assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder of the season the soybean harvest was estimated at billion bushels down percent from billion bushels produced last year prospects last spring called for about billion bushels and the july projection was billion bushels production of all wheat was indicated at billion bushels down percent from billion produced in in may and june the usda forecast this year s output would be up slightly the july projection was billion bushels the wheat total included winter wheat planted last fall which barely stayed ahead of the drought later plantings of durum and other spring wheat varieties were brutalized by heat and dryness winter wheat production was estimated at billion bushels down percent from last year but durum and the other spring varieties which are produced in the hard hit northern plains showed sharp declines durum was estimated at million bushels down percent from last year s harvest and other spring wheat was shown at million bushels down percent from cotton production was estimated at million bales up percent from last year the crop was projected at billion bales in july department officials said u s grain production this year is expected to total million metric tons percent smaller than the output the total grain supply for _ which includes inventories on hand at the beginning of the season _ is down percent from last season in addition to the reductions in corn and soybean yields wilson said production of some other spring planted crops has suffered including oats million bushels down percent barley million bushels also down percent and sorghum million bushels down percent wilson said usda experts continue to believe that the drought will add only one percentage point to consumer food prices this year the department has forecast a food price increase this year of percent to percent before the heat and dry weather usda had expected a food price hike of percent to percent wilson said the drought could add percent to the consumer price index for food next year that s on top of an additional estimated increase in food prices somewhere in the region of percent wilson said so this would bring it up to a total of percent he also said the united states is looking at an export situation that is not as good as it was a year ago he said production abroad would have to take up the slack in world food supply caused by the drought our figures here today would indicate that food production in other countries has not been cut that much he said there remained a possibility that the united states would import some soybeans this year wilson said he scoffed at any suggestion however that the united states may have lost its capacity to produce sizeable crop surpluses he noted that million farm acres are being kept out of production this year in addition to millions of additional acres in the long term conservation reserve program meanwhile usda weatherman norton strommen said rain in the midcontinent in recent days has not meant an end to the drought the drought as you can see is still basically with us throughout the entire united states strommen said
