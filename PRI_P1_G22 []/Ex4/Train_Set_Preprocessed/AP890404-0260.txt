exxon crews tuesday finished pumping the remaining crude oil out of the tanker exxon valdez in preparation for refloating and removing the source of the nation s worst ever oil spill the fugitive captain of the exxon valdez sent signals he was ready to surrender to face criminal charges of operating the vessel while drunk meanwhile exxon said placing an oil catching boom around the ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a giant explosion of gases from the oil although that was not the reason it took hours to set the first containment line the worst thing we could have done early on was try to boom the vessel we would have lost the vessel said exxon shipping co president frank iarossi a boom was n t placed around the vessel for hours because it was n t available in valdez exxon officials have said iarossi also said exxon has changed its policy because of the spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship where drinking is prohibited four hours before sailing authorities charged the captain had been drinking before the valdez sailed thick oil has floated over more than square miles and soiled miles of beach thousands of animals are known dead including sea otters early tuesday exxon said it had finished transferring about million gallons of crude to three other ships another million gallons of oily waste water remained aboard the valdez which spilled more than million gallons of crude into prince william sound when it struck a reef march the company said crews would attempt to pump air into the hold and refloat the vessel off a reef at high tide wednesday afternoon if freed the still leaking ship which has eight holes some feet long in its hull will be towed to a remote and already fouled cove for repairs exxon then planned to take the ship to a port in the far east or to a portland ore dry dock port officials there said they were n t sure if they d allow that even though the million repair bill would provide about jobs we re not willing to trade in the environment for jobs portland port spokesman darrel buttice said monday oregon gov neil goldschmidt said tuesday there are a lot of questions that need to be answered before the valdez is allowed in canadian authorities also asked exxon for assurances there will be no damage to the british columbia coast if the tanker is towed to oregon and the mayor of valdez said the ship was not welcome back in the port where it took on the load of crude in washington environmental protection administrator william reilly said the spill could put the brakes on petroleum exploration there and in other areas we will take apart the environmental planning for every aspect of oil development in alaska and in other sensitive areas where the environment
