is fast becoming one of the worst years on record for tornadoes and flooding across the middle and southern sections of the nation so far this year tornadoes have touched down nationwide well ahead of the tornadoes recorded during the first six months of last year and the year average of tornadoes recorded between january and july said frederick ostby of the national severe storms forecast center here the nation had tornadoes in the first six months of _ one of the biggest years for tornadoes since when the forecast center began keeping reliable records of the storms there were tornadoes reported in we seem to be on a pace that would put us up with those two years ostby said the culprit in this tornado barrage across the plains is a persistent west coast pattern of low pressure in the upper atmosphere that is keeping the jet stream anchored at a southern latitude this year s storms seem particularly violent as illustrated by the march tornado that cut a swath a mile wide and brought winds of mph to a field in kansas the tornado was the strongest to hit the united states since the first weekend in june saw the worst outburst of tornadoes since ostby said tornadoes touched down from kansas to kentucky leaving nine people dead but a break in the storm pattern may be at hand as summer wears on the land warms up and cold air from canada retreats this moves the boundary of the jet stream to the north ostby said our longer range computer forecasts are suggestive of that there is some kind of a readjustment beginning to take place in the upper atmosphere he said however a study of tornado trends indicates parts of the midwest particularly kansas and missouri are heading into a six year period of more intense tornadoes the study of tornadoes since early this century shows that they are concentrated in regions for five or six year periods said michael smith president of weatherdata inc but warning of impending storms is becoming more sophisticated leading to fewer deaths tornadoes have caused deaths this year while an average year in the s saw deaths and in the s nearly ostby said there are better watches better warnings and a better response ostby said ostby credited the quicker response to computers that allow meteorologists to see many sources of data such as satellite readings more clearly flooding in the south and the plains has been as destructive as the tornadoes the death toll from last week s flash floods in shadyside ohio rose to on monday making the flood one of the most deadly in recent years authorities held out little hope for more than a dozen others listed as missing wegee and pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped lcb inches of rain in lcb hours the floods destroyed as many as houses and damaged up to officials said flooding in texas has been blamed for at least deaths since april an estimated people were forced from their homes and high water caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage
