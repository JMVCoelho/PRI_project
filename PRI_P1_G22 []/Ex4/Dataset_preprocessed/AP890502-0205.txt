coast guard commandant paul a yost on tuesday attacked exxon s plan to clean up the alaskan oil spill consumers politicians and environmentalists expressed their anger in a one day boycott exxon campaign yost the top federal official tracking the environmental disaster said exxon s plan was poorly drafted and lacking in specifics but he stopped short of rejecting it saying he wanted to meet with exxon and state officials in washington consumer activist ralph nader said exxon should not be allowed to forget the spill and that a boycott would send the oil giant a message he and others blasted exxon for failing to be prepared for the spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that fouled hundreds of miles of alaska s coast they also questioned subsequent increases in gas prices we are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil company that does n t understand its responsibility to protect the environment massachusetts state sen carol amick told a boycott rally in boston in anchorage about chanting and sign waving protesters rallied in front of exxon s alaskan headquarters to urge a consumer boycott j edward surette jr executive director of the bay state gasoline retailers association in billerica mass said it was too early to assess the boycott s impact exxon spokeswoman sarah johnson said credit cards out of million have been cut up and returned to the company since the spill the oil company s cleanup strategy must gain yost s approval before being put into effect yost said he would make a decision on the proposal within a week the plan is very thin he told a news briefing there s not a lot of backup or substantiation it was quite light very thin there must have been a lot of figures there that i have n t seen we are going to be done this summer yost said some beaches are going to be sparkling some beaches are going to be far from sparkling transportation secretary samuel skinner who is to make his second trip to alaska on wednesday as overall coordinator for the cleanup said he expected the size of the operation to double or triple by the end of the month in a speech at the national press club in washington skinner called the spill the most significant environmental disaster this nation has ever faced however he said the cleanup to be paid for by the oil industry could add million to million to alaska s economy which he said is more than the effect of the fishing industry exxon released a statement that called the boycott unjust exxon president william d stevens said the company was turning heaven and earth to set things right exxon s page two part revised strategy to cleanse some miles of alaska s coastline of the oil spilled march by the tanker exxon valdez was released monday the tanker struck a reef miles from valdez spilling more than million gallons of crude oil into prince william sound about miles from the spill site an observer saw thousands of dead birds in a wide tidal basin in the hallo bay area we saw to dead birds you ca n t really tell what they are they re one big blob of oil said ray bane superintendent of katmai national park about miles southwest of valdez we found large oil debris washing and slopping up on our shores it was very bad bane said we saw eagles carrying oil covered birds we saw one eagle so coated in oil that it could n t fly state and federal officials said the focus of the cleanup is moving southwest following the drifting oil along the alaska peninsula through the shelikof strait east of kodiak island oil has tainted the coast at least as far as chignik miles southwest of valdez the tanker is undergoing preliminary repairs in the sound and is to be moved next month to portland ore home of the only drydock on the west coast capable of handling the foot ship in its proposal exxon said it wants to burn or bury the sludge recovered in the cleanup which may require exemptions from alaska environmental law but bill lamoreaux the ranking state environmental officer at the spill said the laws would not be relaxed the general feeling is that we would expect that they would comply with the environmental laws lamoreaux said exxon s plan also notes that miles of coastline it describes as lightly oiled may be left untouched to be cleansed naturally by wind and water lamoreaux said when we talk about light oiling it does n t mean it wo n t have a devastating effect on wildlife u s sens james exon and bob kerrey both nebraska democrats called on u s attorney general dick thornburgh to investigate potential price gouging by the oil industry they noted that gas prices in nebraska rose percent from the first of march until mid april state attorneys general in washington oregon and idaho echoed the call since the exxon valdez accident gas prices have increased an average percent nationally while the northwest saw surges as high as percent in less than a month said marla rae executive assistant to oregon attorney general dave frohnmayer at a news conference in houston exxon president stevens said it showed shocking naivete to blame the price hikes on his company as you know he told reporters the market for petroleum products is set by thousands of markets thousands of independent dealers across the nation
