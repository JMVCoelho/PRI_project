it was a scene that recalled the golden days for ben johnson almost the media were there as before chronicling a news conference johnson was as before shy and yet brimming with confidence there was the bluster the bragging the promise of big things to come this scene which played out two weeks ago in italy was familiar with one exception the new element was the pervasive skepticism that now attends johnson s boasts overweening confidence among world class athletes is well accepted even expected however part of the expectation includes the understanding that the athlete can back up the boasts johnson will at last get his chance to do that it has been two years since johnson then world record holder at meters was stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for anabolic steroids at the seoul olympics johnson was also suspended from competition for two years that suspension ends today and so the questions begin what can johnson do when not assisted by performance enhancing drugs once he returns to the sport and if he returns a winner all is forgiven said paul gaines assistant meet director for the hamilton spectator indoor games the canadian meet to be held jan that will mark johnson s return to competition i think that is the attitude the public will display you hear grumblings among media types and in some circles of the sport but you have to give the guy the benefit of the doubt when this happened it was a bitter disappointment for everyone in the sport to acknowledge that the no athlete in the sport was using drugs with the accolades cast upon him in the previous years people were resentful with the humility and shame that has been reflected on him people tend to be more open minded about it they hope the guy comes back clean and fast clean and fast to some in track and field that represents a contradiction in terms it is this apparent contradiction that ben johnson must overcome in his comeback charlie francis who coached johnson for years estimated that steroids made johnson faster by one meter how much ground will johnson lose as a drug free sprinter johnson speaking at a news conference in castelfranco veneto italy expressed little doubt he can regain his form of i want to take back the titles and the records i have been deprived of the associated press quoted johnson as saying i have been training very hard recently i am at right now by strengthening training i will be by january i have decided to start again to show everybody i m still the best i m convinced i can set a new world record big money promoters of indoor meets this season doubt that johnson will regain his records but they hope that fans will turn out in huge numbers to watch him try indeed in a season that holds the promise of high performance levels in general lrb as athletes peak for the world indoor championships in seville spain in march rrb johnson s return to competition might help rejuvenate a sport in need of public interest al franken promoter of the sunkist invitational is close to signing johnson for his jan meet saying johnson will receive the highest appearance fee franken has ever paid compared to the franken paid carl lewis and there is a bonus in the contract that rewards johnson for high attendance figures i think honestly you have to figure that a lot of it is curiosity franken said you ll get people who do n t care about track and you may attract back people who have quit coming to track we need a push in the sport it s been struggling we need a hype someone who is a ticket seller ben sort of transcends the sport and god knows we need someone to transcend the sport transcendent is the word for the appearence fees johnson will reportedly earn his value in europe and japan has not waned he will be paid for a meet in stockholm but american meet directors say they ca n t pay that kind of money especially for an unproven runner if he s eligible to compete to me ben johnson is an attraction said ray lumpp meet director for the indoor meet at the meadowlands in east rutherford n j i d like to have ben johnson regardless of how he runs but how well he s running will determine his value that s the key whether he is worth as much after six meets i do n t know you re only as good as your last race and the fans know that howard schmertz of the millrose games in new york has an interest in johnson but perhaps not the budget there is a lot of interest in seeing whether this fellow is a truly great runner or if he is what carl lewis said he is a fair runner who got there by taking drugs schmertz said i have no way of knowing as far as the money i expect a lot of big stars and i m going to have a lot of problems giving out lrb big appearence fees rrb if you give him and people are beating him you could have problems already the backlash has begun there is talk of informal athlete boycotts in canada where indoor meets often provide car fare and little else to star athletes johnson reportedly will be paid lrb canadian rrb for the meet in hamilton a figure that has caused some jealousy among his peers lumpp who traditionally has one of the largest budgets in north america said resentment is a problem faced every season by meet directors how many heavy hitters can a meet afford he said there are very few secrets among athletes especially when there s x dollars given to one athlete hamilton promoter gaines has heard it before and makes no apology for paying johnson more than other athletes my answer to that is who puts lrb fans rrb in the seats right now i ca n t think of anybody who would arouse as much interest as ben johnson it would be ironic if johnson becomes the star who revitalizes indoor track and field after being blamed for the steady decline of sponsor interest in outdoor track there has been damage to the sport and people want to blame ben personally for that damage gaines said we are very cognizant of the fact that people are looking upon his return with something like skepticism and animosity to what extent we do n t know some meet directors report concern that longtime sponsors will be reluctant to be associated with a meet that has johnson as its marquee athlete given johnson s former association with anabolic steroids franken said he had meetings with his sponsor sunkist to discuss the possible image problem schmertz too has given the matter some thought i ve had that thought myself paying him that much money he said he was the greatest sprinter in history then he was caught now he s got a lot of notoriety he probably thinks he can be paid more because of the notoriety it s a very complicated issue i do n t know how the public is going to react are they going to treat him as someone who has paid his penalty and now he s clean i do n t know these questions have gone through my mind will kern meet director for the times indoor games hesitates at considering it a moral issue it s kind of perplexing is n t it kern said i m not god i ca n t say that it s wrong especially when deep down i know johnson s not the only one who s ever taken drugs one thing that may not happen is a much discussed lucrative match race between johnson and lewis i will never allow it to happen primo nebiolo president of the international amateur atheltic federation said sunday we do not allow two horse races a new cast johnson has passed at least four drug tests during his suspension he has been an outspoken opponent of drug use and has spent the last year speaking to children warning them against performance enhancing drugs many of those around johnson have changed too francis is no longer his coach having been replaced by loren seagrave former women s coach at louisiana state university others in johnson s inner circle are larry heidebrecht his agent kameel azan a jamaican born toronto businessman and former hairdresser who is johnson s adviser and ed futerman johnson s attorney the key words in the johnson camp are damage control or more simply control futerman limits johnson s contact with the media saying ben has said all he has to say we do n t need any more media however it was futerman who offered to permit a british journalist to interview johnson if he paid and submitted his questions in advance johnson gave an in depth interview to the german magazine sport but only after being paid other than that he has had a low profile he still is awaiting word from the canadian olympic assn which placed a lifetime ban on johnson that prohibited him from representing canada in the olympic games the coa will meet on friday and is expected to lift the ban that may go a long way to easing johnson back into a sport that disowned him almost as swiftly as he burst on the scene what happened to johnson after his positive test in seoul is similar to what used to happen to famous east europeans after defection any trace of them in their former countries disappeared they no longer existed similarly johnson was erased from track and field s record books not only did he have to give back the gold medal but he lost two world records causing the sport to change its rules in order to take them the iaaf voted last september to adopt the controversial ben johnson rule allowing the iaaf council to decertify an athlete s records titles and results if he or she later is shown to have used a banned substance before those performances the action gave the iaaf power to erase all of johnson s results between june and june even though johnson admitted to having taken drugs since the rule carries a six year statue of limitations the rule stripped johnson of his world record of in the meters and in the indoor meters already gone was the race from the olympics the records are gone but not forgotten the question remains is ben johnson capable of running at that brilliant level again meet promoters are willing to pay to find out if the public will pay to watch johnson is another question said lumpp of the meadowlands you do n t have just a track and field story here you have a human interest story here s a person who has reached the top of everything lost it all and now he s coming back to run will he be the same johnson i do n t know but people are willing to find out
