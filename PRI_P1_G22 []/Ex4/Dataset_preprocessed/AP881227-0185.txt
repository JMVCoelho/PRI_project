secretive fanatics are becoming a political force that seeks public support in huaycan and the other makeshift communities where two thirds of lima s million people scrape along about people live in huaycan their huts built of straw mats line the bone dry slopes of the andean foothills miles east of downtown lima most residents are poor migrants from the violent highlands where the rebel movement

rebels or security forces and official figures put damage to the shattered economy at billion the guerrillas are believed to have only about armed combatants so they do not appear close to seizing power but there is increasing pessimism about the prospects of controlling them most evaluations of sendero luminoso s eight year expansion under the democratic system have become increasingly grim the andean report a respected economic journal said recently one reason the movement grows is its appeal to peru s indians subjected for centuries to scorn and discrimination by the white ruling elite

on counterinsurgency say shining path appears bent on dominating the radical left of legal politics officials have become alarmed by the broadening of tactics to include infiltration of legitimate organizations including unions of government workers they say this clouds distinctions between the legal and illegal left making it move difficult to combat the rebel movement sendero is seeking semi legal status as a way of winning militants and sympathizers while at the same time generating a confusing situation in which the security forces indiscrimately repress members of the legal left along with leftist insurgents a ranking police official said privately guzman a marxist philosophy professor founded sendero luminoso in in ayacucho an andean state capital miles southeast of lima where he had built a following at the university of huamanga followers call guzman the fourth sword of marxism after marx lenin and mao his movement a splinter group of the communist party gathered strength in indian communities of the southern andes for years before launching its guerrilla war according to counterinsurgency experts the guerrillas switched their emphasis to the cities because migration of indian peasants to urban centers accelerated after the highlands became a battlefield guzman s guerrillas have followed tens of thousands of peasants from the andes into lima s shantytowns and see the slums as a new stronghold in july the pro shining path newspaper el diario published a page report on the guerrilla movement it quoted guzman as saying in his first interview since going underground in we had to follow the road from the countryside to the city we must prepare for the insurrection that is coming which means the taking of the cities he said conditions were ripe for the next stage in the struggle for power inciting a coup against president alan garcia by provoking economic chaos and increasing attacks on the army the final stage he said would be a popular uprising against a

slums where shining path works hardest because it is just off the central highway a strategic route through the capital s main industrial zone to the mountains the industrial zone contains of the country s most important factories red painted slogans hailing the people s war and president gonzalo the rebel name for guzman cover the concrete block clinic other buildings with solid walls and even large rocks residents were suspicious and uncommunicative when an associated press reporter visited except for three year old boys at the entrance who laughed and waved red flags with the shining path s hammer and sickle emblem the central highway passes through what looks like a military zone most factories are behind high walls topped with barbed wire and towers from which guards with automatic rifles keep watch guerrillas killed three plant managers in who were involved in labor disputes union leaders also are uneasy i doubt if you ll find any union leader who will declare he is a senderista but i ll bet you ll find many who are afraid to say anything against sendero an american labor adviser said on condition of anonymity the highway ties lima to the agricultural lands of the central andes and peru s most important mines where unions threatened by the shining path have conducted a strike since late october that costs millions of dollars a day in export earnings end adv for
