i believe that society is now in a position to vigorously enforce equal rights for all americans but i believe in compensation for actual victims not for people whose only claim to victimization is that they are members of a historically oppressed group america should not fall into the trap of blaming all the problems faced by blacks or other minorities on others we are not beggars or objects of charity we do n t get smarter just because we sit next to white people in class and we do n t progress just because society is ready with handouts as a people we need to find solutions to problems through independence perseverance and integrity as a society we should develop better policies to deal with the underclass than the failed solutions of the past while the views of president bush s first supreme court nominee david souter were virtually unknown before his confirmation the year old mr thomas has boldly articulated his vision of constitutional law both as a judge he now sits on the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the nation s second highest bench and before that as chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission for eight years basically the job of a judge is to figure out what the law says not what he wants it to say mr thomas told me there is a difference between the role of a judge and that of a policy maker lcb judge robert rcb bork was right about that no question judging requires a certain impartiality at the same time impartiality is not the same thing as indifference this is n t law school speculation when i hear a case i know damn well that something is going to happen as a result of what i decide people s lives are affected sometimes a man s life depends on the outcome and these are people looking to me to the judge to figure out what s just to correctly apply the law that s not a responsibility i take lightly no way many of mr thomas s critics have taken his unconcealed admiration for ronald reagan his former boss and robert bork his predecessor on the d c circuit as evidence that mr thomas shares their philosophy of jurisprudence but in fact a careful reading of his articles and speeches reveals a different sort of judicial conservatism writing in the howard law journal in mr thomas argued for what he called a natural law or higher law mode of judging in which the judge examines not only the text of the constitution or statute but also the moral principles underlying the american form of government mr thomas maintains with support from abraham lincoln and abolitionist frederick douglass that the constitution must be read in the context of the principle of equality inherent in the declaration of independence in a powerful speech mr thomas gave on martin luther king day three years ago he defended certain forms of civil disobedience king often quoted thomas aquinas s statement an unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law part of king s legacy for mr thomas is his reflection on the close connection between law and morality president bush s nominee understands the hostility he is likely to face in congress when you re up before those confirmation hearings it s like going through dante s inferno i ve seen a glimpse of that process when you get up there you just hope that you do n t get destroyed so that even if you do n t make it you can go on with your life mr thomas is likely to be a very different kind of judge from the man he is replacing when reminded of thurgood marshall s comment that he could not wholeheartedly celebrate the bicentennial of the american founding because the constitution permitted slavery mr thomas shook his head i have felt the pain of racism as much as anyone else mr thomas says passionately yet i am wild about the constitution and about the declaration abraham lincoln once said that the american founders declared the right of equality whose enforcement would follow as soon as circumstances permitted the more i learn about the ideals of those men the more enthusiastic i get i believe in the american proposition the american dream because i ve seen it in my own life mr thomas s life is a remarkable story born in a small frame house on the outskirts of savannah ga in mr thomas endured all the hardships of the segregated south his father left before he could walk and his mother worked as a housemaid and picked crabs from the marsh to eat and sell the family shared a single outhouse with several neighbors in the summer of clarence thomas and his brother went to live with their maternal grandparents who owned an ice delivery and fuel oil business it is here under the stern tutelage of his grandfather myers anderson that mr thomas locates the beginning of his true education my grandfather has been the greatest single influence on my life he claims in he told the atlantic when the civil rights people indict me the man they are indicting is that man let them call him from the grave and indict him as mr thomas remembers his grandfather believed that man ai n t got no business on relief as long as he can work damn welfare that relief rsb at home the thomas boys worked six hours a day in addition to school raising the chickens pigs and cows cleaning the house and the yard painting roofing plumbing and fixing maintaining the oil trucks and making deliveries these lessons of hard work personal dignity and self sufficiency were reinforced through years of catholic school and college he finished his undergraduate studies at holy cross college in worcester mass that s where i started to get political and radical mr thomas recalls i read malcolm x i became interested in the black panthers in he founded the black student union at holy cross he went on to yale law school where he worked summers at new haven legal assistance continuing what he calls my political consciousness raising nevertheless i never gave up my grandfather s ideals and when my left wing opinions began to clash with those ideals i began to move away from the left eventually he took a job with missouri attorney general lrb now senator rrb john danforth because he promised to treat me like anyone else he promised to ignore the hell out of me at a conference of black conservatives in san francisco calif mr thomas s eloquent departures from the civil rights orthodoxy on quotas and government handouts greatly impressed the newly installed reagan administration and in he was nominated to be assistant secretary for civil rights in the department of education the next year he was promoted to the top job of the eeoc under the carter administration the agency had zealously promoted numerical goals and timetables thomas came in and he rejected all that remarks william robinson dean of the district of columbia school of law mr thomas had his skirmishes with the leadership conference on civil rights an umbrella group instrumental in defeating the bork nomination and he made a dangerous enemy in the american association of retired persons which accused him of letting legal protections for the elderly lapse when he was nominated to the d c circuit in late a number of these special interest groups prepared for a bloodbath but the storm clouds melted away and mr thomas was approved by the senate judiciary with a majority the full senate seated him with only two senators opposed the reason for the smooth passage eeoc vice chairman ricky silber man lrb whose husband laurence silberman sits on the d c circuit with mr thomas and is his closest friend on the bench rrb thinks is that clarence has an amazing ability to neutralize opposition just as in his life he turns negative values into positive values an amazing feat can clarence thomas be confirmed to the supreme court even liberal judges will go on record praising mr thomas if i or a member of my family were in trouble he is the kind of person i d like to appear before judge damon keith a carter appointee on the sixth circuit court of appeals in detroit said in an interview our judicial philosophy may not be the same but he is a bright and reflective man who believes passionately in fairness i say this without reservation and in full knowledge of all the people who complain about him dean robinson added people often confuse what clarence thinks with what some of his friends on the right think but clarence is his own man while at the eeoc mr thomas gave speeches accusing the republican party of blatant indifference toward black voters and chastised ronald reagan in particular for letting bob jones university get away with racial discrimination and for foot dragging on the voting rights act extension mr thomas and his wife virginia live in northern virginia with jamal mr thomas s son from a previous marriage some weeks before word of the nomination came mr thomas confessed to being slightly bemused by all the attention being paid to him by scholars and courtwatchers the problem for my opponents and for my friends is that i do n t think i fit any of these molds very well once people figure this out maybe they ll leave me alone mr d souza a research fellow at the american enterprise institute is the author of illiberal education the politics of race and sex on campus lrb free press macmillan rrb
