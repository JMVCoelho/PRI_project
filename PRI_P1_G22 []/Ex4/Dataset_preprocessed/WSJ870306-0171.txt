confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst diamond slump since the s de beers consolidated mines ltd the south african concern that controls of the world s uncut diamond market is thriving the organization of petroleum exporting countries is floundering and the international tin cartel has collapsed but de beers not only halted a fall in rough diamond prices it raised them an average last year sales still soared to a near record billion double the billion posted in the doldrums de beers managed the comeback by convincing diamond producers dealers and the jewelry industry that its marketing muscle was indispensable selling diamonds is the business of dealers and jewelers helping them to sell more is ours says stephen lussier a de beers marketing executive de beers helped with an advertising and promotion budget that swelled to million this year up from million in supplemented by million spent by the diamond trade the de beers campaign helped raise world sales of diamond jewelry to million pieces valued at billion in up from million pieces valued at billion in figures for are n t yet available but de beers says it was another record the promotional budget covers market research a world wide network of as many as public relations officials and advertising campaigns coordinated by the agencies n w ayer son in the u s and j walter thompson co in other countries the master sales plan began in when former de beers chairman harry oppenheimer asked ayer to woo american couples to buy expensive diamond engagement rings today the u s is the world s no market with billion in annual retail diamond jewelry sales or about a share even though a antitrust law prevents de beers from operating directly there about three fourths of american women own diamond engagement rings that cost an average de beers s strategy is two pronged says mr lussier general diamond image advertising aims at perpetuating the mystique of quality diamonds as the ultimate expression of love he says de beers applied similar promotional techniques world wide one out of japanese couples bought engagement rings two decades ago now two thirds do and japan is the second largest diamond jewelry market followed by west germany de beers s central selling organization known as the syndicate is the pipeline between diamond mines and dealers based mainly in antwerp belgium bombay india tel aviv israel and new york as the sole middleman de beers usually avoids the acrimony that has divided other cartels the syndicate has purchase contracts with de beers s own mines in south africa and namibia lrb a territory controlled by south africa rrb other african states such as botswana zaire and sierra leone and australia de beers offers its cache to select dealers times a year at sales known as sights each dealer gets a box containing uncut diamonds the dealer must accept or reject the entire box valued at between million and million if the dealer refuses to buy de beers may never invite him back this ritual has enabled de beers to maintain price stability the cartel has n t cut prices since it was founded more than half a century ago despite grumbling diamond dealers generally believe that a healthy international diamond market depends on the syndicate opec members tend to do what they like says jo flies chief economist of the antwerp diamond council but de beers is unique he says in influencing production and consumption of diamonds people mesmerized by the producers cartels forget that de beers is an aggressive ruthless and effective sales organization says a london dealer some analysts warn however that de beers s future may be affected by the surge in diamond output elsewhere notably australia world diamond production has soared to million carats from million carats in a carat equals of an ounce about of the prize diamonds are produced in southern africa but the market is being flooded by cheaper diamonds mainly from australia and zaire the soviet union which produces an estimated million carats of top grade diamonds annually is another unknown de beers has a sales arrangement with the soviets but moscow has dumped diamonds before and may prove difficult to keep in line angola left the cartel last year partly because it is involved in a bitter war with south african backed rebels other african nations in the cartel want more control over distribution dealers say de beers ca n t stop evolution says jack lunzer chairman of idc holdings ltd a london based diamond firm that sells diamonds for guinea an african nation that is n t a cartel member while sales independence from de beers could be disastrous for the market mr lunzer says that wo n t deter those producers who want more information and knowledge about final sales of their material but the fate of de beers south africa s most famous company will depend largely on developments in that troubled country dealers say international sanctions including a possible u s import ban on south african diamonds pose a growing threat recent history indicates however that it would be hasty to write off the cartel in zaire which mines of world diamond output left the cartel australia was about to open a huge diamond mine and a speculative boom had led to widespread dealer bankruptcies the monopoly was threatened with extinction while average prices of de beers s rough diamonds rose prices of polished diamonds in dealers stocks collapsed the top grade investment diamond d flawless tumbled to around a carat in from an average of in in a series of shrewd moves de beers forced zaire to rejoin the cartel by dumping diamonds meanwhile diamond demand by consumers increased fueled by de beers s promotion campaign and favorable economic trends dealers say trade is buoyant again because of lower interest rates and a weak dollar that makes dollar priced diamonds cheaper in japan and europe since november prices of d flawless diamonds have risen to around a carat de beers is powerful it is everywhere says alfred lachowsky chairman of the antwerp diamond high council the cartel will continue to control world diamond markets mr lachosky says you ca n t
