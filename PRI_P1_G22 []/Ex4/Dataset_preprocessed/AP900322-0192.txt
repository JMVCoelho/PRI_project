the diamond business loses some sparkle sales have declined sharply and the year old cartel is facing pressure to give producers better terms and allow them to sell more of their own gems although its prosperity and control of the world diamond industry looks unchallengeable the pressures could loosen its grip and crimp its profits this year is going to be a critical one for de beers says diamond intelligence briefs a trade publication de beers south african interests face an uncertain future largely because of a newly energized political will by the black majority in that country an important diamond producer the african national congress has pledged to nationalize south africa s major sources of wealth if it takes power apparently attempting to limit risk de beers recently announced it would split south african and foreign interests into two publicly held companies one based in switzerland after growth spurts of percent in and percent in rough diamond sales fell percent to billion last year because of slowing economies high interest rates and the organization s two double digit price increases in and the decline was sharpest in the second half of the year when sales fell percent from the first six months there was a very definite noticeable slack in demand said analyst peter miller of yorkton securities inc in london the decline has limited de beers scope for raising prices this past week de beers announced it was increasing prices percent compared to a percent increase a year earlier the organization must this year renegotiate five year contracts with botswana the second biggest diamond producer in terms of value and argyle diamonds of western australia the biggest producer in terms of quantity the government of newly independent namibia meanwhile is expected to demand a one fifth stake in consolidated diamond mines de beers namibian subsidiary the organization sells most of the soviet union s west bound diamonds but the soviets the biggest value producer have been acting more independently and squeezing the cartel s margins the experts say jack lunzer managing director of idc ltd an independent diamond distributor in london said de beers undoubtedly will continue to control the major part of world production but its marketing arm s profits will fall the effect has n t been felt yet de beers profit rose percent to billion in few diamond producing countries dare sell their output outside the organization and some bold enough to leave have returned because of the difficulty in peddling diamonds alone zaire returned in after a two year split angola which broke in has been negotiating its re entry we are as strongly in control of the diamond market as we have been for many years said tim capon the cartel s director the organization buys rough diamonds from de beers own mines which represent percent of world production and from producers in tanzania south africa zaire botswana namibia australia and the soviet union it reveals few details about security it was robbed once in the early s when some diamonds were snatched as couriers carried them from one building to another de beers picks its or so buying customers from thousands of hopefuls ten times a year at sales called sights the clients are offered a selection of diamonds chosen by the organization and placed in a simple cardboard box the buyer basically can take it or leave it the gems then go to cutters in the world s major diamond cutting centers bombay india tel aviv israel antwerp belgium and new york of all diamonds mined only percent will end up in jewelry but these represent percent of the value of the world s diamond production the rest are put to industrial use the organization is fighting the lackluster sales trend by trying to create new demand last year it spent million on advertising and promotion trying for example to boost purchases of men s diamond jewelry de beers s achievement over the decades has been to mass market what was once an aristocratic luxury without greatly diminishing its value today diamonds remain the gem of gems although millions of people own them de beers insists it seeks long term stability and prosperity for the industry saying price fluctuations would undermine confidence in the value of diamonds so far it has succeeded while other commodities markets have suffered repeated convulsions rough diamond prices have n t fallen since the organization started announcing price changes in even its fiercest competitors laud de beers for putting up considerable amounts of money and assuming the risks to develop mines and support the market during the early s when high interest rates caused the worst diamond slump since the s the organization prevented the market s collapse by doubling its diamond stockpile to nearly billion worth but producers criticize the organization s secretiveness and what they call its arbitrary valuation system some want more of the industry s millions of jobs relocated in their own countries said lunzer it s not unnatural for people in the producing countries to say are we getting a proper share of the value of our national resource after reviewing a complaint filed by the british mining company consolidated gold fields plc alleging anti competitive practices britain s office of fair trading decided in august against formally investigating whether the organization abuses its monopoly gold fields acknowledged the complaint was a defensive maneuver against a hostile and ultimately unsuccessful takeover bid from oppenheimer controlled minorco sa last year formally known as de beers consolidated mines ltd and based in kimberley south africa the company was formed in by the british industrial colonialist cecil rhodes sir ernest oppenheimer a diamond merchant became chairman of de beers in and five years later formed diamond trading co the precursor of today s cartel oppenheimer who linked the diamond business with his extensive anglo american corp gold mining interests is credited with steering de beers through the depression he died in and was succeeded by his son harry oppenheimer who has made the company more internationally minded and therefore less vulnerable now oppenheimer still serves on de beers board of directors of which he previously was chairman his year old son and heir apparent nicholas is deputy to chairman
