a police chief plays an essential role in setting the climate in which his department operates through the years mr gates has made public statements clearly at odds with the new concept of community policing in which officers work with citizens to improve neighborhoods and prevent crime a few years ago chief gates referred to gang members as dirty little cowards and warned them that there is resounding applause to every fall of the hammer the exchange sounded more like one gang challenging another than a police chief seeking to reduce conflict in the community indeed the rambo like challenge did not lower violence and may have increased it hundreds of gang homicides occur every year in los angeles despite sweeps by the city s police mr gates would have been better advised to seek community programs for jobs education elimination of prejudice and improvement of neighborhoods but this kind of reasoning is foreign to a man who publicly claimed that his swat team could free the iranian hostages similarly mr gates vehemently opposed the police corps program backed by other police chiefs the police corps would send idealistic young people including minorities to serve a three or four year tour of duty after college graduation in return for federal funding of their educations mr gates opposed the police corps because its members would not be professionals yet the presence of such non professionals would discourage the racism and brutality exposed by the rodney king beating such attitudes survive only in a closed police culture the presence of even one police corps officer witness would have deterred the criminal cops many chiefs openly disagreed with mr gates when he opposed the police corps bill in congress we should be as openly critical of his other statements for example mr gates once said that blacks were more susceptible than normal people to chokeholds more recently he described the killer of a policewoman as an el salvadoran who should n t have been here the nationality of the murderer was irrelevant mr gates s statement did nothing to lessen the tragedy of the fallen officer but like his statement about blacks it gave comfort to bigots within and outside the department and it hardly reduced conflict in a city where the majority of the population is made up of minorities who need and deserve police protection whether or not they are citizens two years ago on a national television documentary mr gates defended a special unit that had shot many criminals during stakeouts the unit had advance knowledge that crimes were about to occur but often stayed outside and let robberies occur even though innocent retailers and customers were put at risk the chief said that arresting the criminals before the robberies was n t a good idea because the courts were so lenient the unit has been allowed to continue to operate despite its high shooting rate or worse still because of the shootings last year los angeles paid million to residents of an apartment complex ransacked by police mr gates reluctantly admitted that the officers who did the ransacking were wrong but said he could understand their frustration in trying to fight drugs even more recently mr gates told the senate that casual drug users should be taken out and shot he assured the senators that he was not being facetious and his initial reaction on television to the rodney king brutality tapes was defensive mayor tom bradley told the media that such conduct would n t be tolerated and that the wrongdoers would be sought out for punishment mr gates said that while he was shocked he was n t drawing conclusions and would look into the background of the incident presumably the chief has now received wiser council he has called for prosecution of three of the officers and has produced a videotape for his troops condemning the beating but condemnation of misconduct and excessive force should have been a constant message from the command staff before the brutality and not an afterthought yet it s hard to imagine commanders preaching restraint in light of the chief s constant belligerent pronouncements even mr gates s apology to mr king sent the wrong message he said that he hoped the incident might help mr king to straighten out his life it is hard to imagine someone unlawfully beaten by uniformed officers as others looked on being inspired to respect law and order or was the chief suggesting that the beating was a warning against further run ins with the police clearly daryl gates s words and actions create doubt about his claim that the rodney king incident was an aberration public opinion polls in los angeles show the majority of people believe police brutality is common and they disapprove of the way mr gates has done his job when he characterizes such opposition as cop haters he embitters his department and to some extent all police mr gates s military style of policing is at odds with that in the rest of the country and it s about time police leaders publicly repudiated it it is hard to see how the los angeles police department can regain credibility unless daryl gates s leave becomes permanent but the videotape of the lapd brutality affects the credibility of all police officers it has cast a cloud over policing that wo n t be lifted until police chiefs drop their own code of silence and speak out against one of their own s peculiar philosophy of policing mr mcnamara is the police chief in san jose he comes from a family of policemen and has been one for years
