based on the new findings mr gray predicted earlier this summer that the tropical storm season would be above average and so far he seems to be right in july he said there would be storms severe enough to be named of which six would be hurricanes the national hurricane center said that as of yesterday there have been nine named storms this year including four hurricanes a higher rate than normal weather researchers have been seeking to predict hurricane patterns more accurately as an early warning for coastal residents of the u s and the caribbean a sharp decrease in hurricane activity over the past two decades spurred business and residential development that would be vulnerable to increased hurricane activity mr gray said the west african sahel region is the newest of five indicators he uses to predict global hurricane activity atlantic hurricanes form from especially strong tropical storms that are triggered by winds and other air disturbances that sweep across africa wind moving across warm ocean air causes powerful updrafts of air bearing sea water that eventually turn into rainclouds mr gray said he believes that in the absence of moisture these storms quickly dissipate but that the storms gather strength with additional moisture mr gray said his research published in the current issue of science suggests that intense caribbean hurricanes gilbert joan and hugo of and may be the forerunners of this change comparing year to year rainfall levels in the sahel with the number of high powered atlantic hurricanes mr gray found a striking correlation from to for instance rainfall in the western sahel was especially abundant and during this time there were severe hurricanes that formed in the atlantic ocean from to the sahel suffered through a terrible drought and hurricane activity was unusually low only one severe hurricane gloria in formed in the area mr gray searched back in recent history and found that the sahel which includes parts of senegal mauritania mali and gambia goes through long periods of alternating dry and wet weather he found that the sahel was especially wet from to and from to hurricane activity was much higher during this time than during intervals when the sahel was dry mr gray predicted that based on historical cycles the sahel is entering a wet period he said the drought conditions ended in and he based his storm forecast on the higher than normal rainfall in the sahel in july mr gray said his research suggests that climate changes in the sahel do n t result from global warming problems associated with environmental pollution but from natural weather cycles
