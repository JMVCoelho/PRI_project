mad cow disease has killed cattle restricted the export market for britain s cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef the government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health but scientists still are n t certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted i think everyone agrees that the risks are low says martin raff a neurobiologist at university college london but they certainly are not zero i have not changed my eating habits but i certainly do wonder mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse was diagnosed only in the symptoms are very much like scrapie a sheep disease which has been in britain since the s the incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its victims in late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger drunkenly the suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed which used to contain sheep by products as a protein supplement the government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in june and later banned the use of cattle brain spleen thymus intestines and spinal cord in food for humans sheep offal is still used in pig and poultry feed earlier this month the government announced it would pay farmers percent of market value or average market price whichever is less for each animal diagnosed with bse i think it is a recognition _ not just of pressure from farmers _ but that the public would feel more confident that no bse infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was percent compensation said sir simon gourlay president of the national farmers union the disease struck one of his own cows gourlay said in the course of hours the animal went from being ostensibly quite normal to very vicious and totally disoriented as of feb the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food said that cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with bse the government has paid million in compensation and is budgeting million for ireland s department of agriculture and food said about cases have been confirmed there all of them near the border with the british province of northern ireland because of the disease the u s department of agriculture s animal and plant health inspection service banned imports of cattle embryos and bull semen from great britain in july said margaret webb a usda spokeswoman in washington similar embargoes have been imposed by australia finland israel sweden west germany and new zealand according to the agriculture ministry and the european community has proposed a ban on exports of british cattle older than months david maclean a junior agriculture minister has complained of bse hysteria in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is remote the government has committed million to finding the cause of the disease a commission chaired by professor sir richard southwood of oxford university reported last year that the cause of bse is quite unlike any bacteria or known viruses the report said the disease was impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it did not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies the southwood report said it was most unlikely that the disease was a threat to humans but the report added if our assessments of these likelihoods are incorrect the implications would be extremely serious there is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy known as creutzfeldt jakob disease about two dozen cases were reported in britain last year another form known as kuru had been found cannibals in new guinea according to a report in the british medical journal the incidence of creutzfeldt jakob disease is no higher in britain than it is in countries free of scrapie it is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect of bse on human health a consultative committee reported to the agriculture ministry the committee s report released early this year said it is only a shrewd guess that bse was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed
