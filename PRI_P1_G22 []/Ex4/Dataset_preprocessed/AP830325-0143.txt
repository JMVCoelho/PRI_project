millions of gallons of crude oil that spilled when a tanker ran aground spread across a wildlife rich stretch of ocean saturday and alaska s chief environmental officer criticized cleanup efforts as too slow the biggest oil spill in u s history created a slick about seven miles long and seven miles wide in prince william sound the coast guard said only reef island and the western edge of bligh island had been touched by the slick this situation i think was everyone s secret nightmare about what could happen with oil traffic in the sound said dennis kelso commissioner of the alaska department of environmental conservation some barrels _ about gallons _ of crude oil from alaska s north slope spilled early friday when the foot tanker exxon valdez ran hard aground on bligh reef about miles outside valdez where it had taken on a total cargo of million barrels initial reports indicated barrels had spilled what we have here is a major environmental catastrophe said one oil spill expert richard golob of boston publisher of golob oil pollution bulletin golob said cleanup equipment at the site was grossly inadequate but added that even under ideal circumstances cleanup efforts would not have significantly reduced the spill s impact it is an enclosed body of water he said the only way for this oil to ecape out to the sea is by traversing the entire length of prince william sound with all its islands fjords and bays and channels and during that transit undoubtedly a large stretch of shoreline will be contaminated he said divers saturday said they had found six to eight holes in the vessel s hull large enough to swim through said frank iarossi president of exxon shipping co about feet of the vessel is resting on a shelf on the reef efforts to begin pumping gallons of oil off the exxon valdez onto another tanker the exxon baton rouge were halted early saturday when authorities noticed that oil appeared to leaking as the pumping operation proceeded eleven of tanks that lie forward of the ship s masthead were ruptured in the accident causing concern over removal of the oil said coast guard lt ed wieliczkiewicz whenever you start removing oil from a vessel this size it has to be done in a controlled manner wieliczkiewicz said if it s not you endanger the stability of the vessel wieliczkiewicz said a boom was placed around the exxon valdez and the exxon baton rouge to help contain oil around the vessels he also said four members of the coast guard s pacific strike team from san francisco specially trained to deal with pollution and oil spills arrived saturday and were helping to rig pumps and assemble equipment needed to transfer oil to the baton rouge kelso was highly critical of what he said was a slow response to the spill the initial reponse was inadequate and unacceptable he said before a news conference saturday kelso said the efforts should have been under way in five hours but took much longer you miss the opportunity right at the beginning and you ve missed our best opportunity to do something kelso said alaska has a plan for oil spills that calls for action within five hours of a spill it took several hours longer he said and only two of seven skimmers available to the alyeska pipeline service co were used at the outset alyeska spokesman chuck o donnel said he was satisfied with his company s actions i think our people did an excellent job he said the spill s effect on wildlife had not yet been assessed but commercial fishermen who depend on the sound for a catch worth millions of dollars were outraged and said a key herring spawning area had been polluted the whole food chain could be affected by the spill said alan reichman ocean ecology coordinator for the environmental group greenpeace in seattle there s a high concentration of sea otter waterfowl sea birds and pink salmon in that area said steve goldstein a spokesman for the interior department in washington some birds have already died and we are doing our best to try to save the fish by containing the oil to the area where it presently is and by trying to skim it whales porpoises and seals are also common in prince william sound it s kind of like sailing through a zoo said jim lethcoe who lives on a boat in the sound and operates a sailing business an animal cleanup station was set up in a building at the community college in valdez but volunteers there said they had no animals to work on by midafternoon the response to the spill also drew fire from the member united fishermen of alaska we feel that this should have been the easiest oil spill in the world to clean up said riki ott chairman of the organization s habitat committee she noted that the spill had occurred in a protected area close to the valdez marine terminal and the water was calm ott said the spill had polluted prince william sound s primary herring spawning area fishermen also take salmon and shellfish from the sound last year they were paid about million for their catches she said the port of valdez remained closed to tanker traffic north slope crude oil is shipped miles through the trans alaska oil pipeline from prudhoe bay south to valdez for shipment aboard tankers to refineries outside alaska the coast guard said the exxon valdez struck the reef when it maneuvered outside normal tanker traffic lanes to avoid icebergs the vessel s captain joseph hazelwood has worked for exxon for years at least as a ship s master it was unclear if a pilot was aboard the exxon valdez when it grounded there was no decision saturday on whether to use chemicals to disperse the oil but a test of the dispersal method was being conducted saturday afternoon as was a test to determine whether at least some of the crude oil could be burned coast guard cmdr steven mccall said national transportation safety board investigators are expected to arrive sunday to take over the accident probe he said one or more blood alcohol tests were administered after the grounding but he said he did n t know know how many people were tested or the results mccall said the tests routinely are administered in marine accidents involving federal jurisdiction the coast guard issued a statement late saturday that mccall has subpoenaed the ship s master and two crew members the subpoenas require them to make themselves available to ntsb investigators arriving sunday the coast guard said the supoenas were routine previously the largest u s tanker spill was the dec grounding of the argo merchant tanker off the nantucket shoals off massachusetts in which million gallons of oil spilled golob said up to million gallons of oil was lost on nov when the tanker burmah agate collided with another ship in galveston bay texas however that oil burned as well as spilled the largest tanker spill in history resulted from the july collision off tobago of the supertankers atlantic empress and aegean captain in which tons _ more than million gallons _ of oil was lost
