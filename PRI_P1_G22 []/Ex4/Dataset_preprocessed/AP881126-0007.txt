further study of a newly isolated hormone found in the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for the most common form of the disease a scientist says we have a lot of evidence that this is likely to be if not the final cause at least a major part of the disease process said new zealand biochemist garth cooper the research opens the door to the scientific study of the disease at a level that was n t possible before and potentially the mechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging he said cooper who has been working with scientists at oxford university described the hormone research this week at the th international diabetes federation congress in sydney australia in his presentation cooper said the hormone dubbed amylin was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreases of diabetics amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity reduced insulin secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in type ii diabetes he said currently obesity is considered a major contributor to the disease rather than a result of it insulin normally controls the level of blood sugar in type ii diabetes also called non insulin dependent diabetes the body s insulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high complications can include kidney disease blindness and gangrene that requires amputations type ii diabetes afflicts the majority of the nation s estimated million diabetics according to the american diabetes association it often can be controlled through diet and exercise cooper said researchers hope to develop substances that block amylin s secretion or action opening the possibility of treatment he also said reseachers hope to develop a test to detect diabetes very early in its development the new work is a very important finding if amylin truly blocks insulin and appears in abnormal amounts in diabetics f xavier pi sunyer an authority on type ii diabetes said friday scientists already knew of another pancreatic hormone that blocks insulin but it is not found in abnormal levels in diabetics said pi sunyer director of the endocrinology diabetes and nutrition division at st luke s roosevelt hospital center in new york
