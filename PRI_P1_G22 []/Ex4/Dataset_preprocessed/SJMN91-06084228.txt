st martin s pp charlie francis testifying in in toronto at a federal inquiry about the use of performance enhancing drugs in sports seemed a mad scientist something on the order of dr frankenstein francis the canadian national sprint coach knew the polysyllabic names and complex characteristics of steroids furazabol stanozolol dianabol as if they were members of his family and although he spoke of his athletes as if they were family members too he made it plain under oath that he had given them every steroid combination imaginable his experiments all carefully calibrated charted and analyzed his system had worked remarkably on sept francis most famous pupil ben johnson who immigrated to toronto from jamaica as a scrawny year old ran meters in seconds at the olympics in seoul south korea the time was a world record and gave johnson the gold medal ahead of the defending champion u s star carl lewis but the francis system like all systems was not foolproof about hours after my life s greatest moment francis writes on the first page of his confessional speed trap his nightmare began johnson the world s fastest man had tested positive for illegal steroid use suddenly he was the world s fastest cheat millions of dollars worth of endorsements shriveled up his gold medal was revoked and his world record was too because johnson was caught the canadians were embarrassed because they were embarrassed they conducted a federal inquiry because they held an inquiry francis had to testify and because of that testimony we have speed trap an elaboration of what francis said at the inquiry and a history of his remarkable path through the world of track and field he argues essentially that to be a world class sprinter you must use steroids he makes this argument even as johnson attempts a comeback for the olympic games in barcelona spain without them steroids do not make a runner run faster francis explains but they enable a runner to train harder the desire for speed comes with incredible costs and they are the trap by encouraging his athletes to use steroids and francis maintains that they all wanted to do so and knew about steroids before the coach brought the subject up francis argues that he is simply helping to create a level playing field we learn that the use of performance enhancing drugs is nothing new in the world of sports that cocaine and arsenic and codeine were used by athletes in the olympic games we learn that johnson harmed his own world record times by raising his hand jubilantly as he approached the finish line we learn that if athletes take steroids on their own independent of an official lrb but still illicit of course rrb program it s called free lancing that s one of francis theories for why johnson got caught but francis says there is no logical reason for johnson to have been caught after all he had never been caught before no one of johnson s standing had been caught before francis offers theories for the positive test result free lancing sabotage a screw up by the team doctor but there is no clear answer for all its candor answers and revelations are not forthcoming in speed trap francis without naming names convinces us that steroid usage is rampant but he tells us what that means to him only in a technical sense the book lacks a strong sense of character development it does not take any moral stand it lacks passion how did francis feel violating the rules what drove him what did he really feel toward johnson after a two year ban johnson is running again without francis coaching the early word is that he is still extremely fast probably one of the fastest men in the world but no longer the fastest francis would have us believe that without steroids johnson can not be the fastest lrb johnson disagrees rrb at the end of speed trap francis says that steroids can not be simply banned their use is too prevalent they can be disguised too easily and they work too well the dangers have been exaggerated francis says people who want running to be a natural sport are naive we ceased being natural ages ago the moment we stopped running barefoot on dirt paths francis writes it is a formidable challenge to distinguish between nature and artifice a task i would leave to the philosophers but speed trap left me wishing francis had at least tried his hand at philosophy is n t that everyone s responsibility to ask why we do the things we do but i was a sprint coach and i had a different job he concludes to help a few gifted people run as fast as they could they ran fast all right but he never seems to have asked himself is it worth it lrb box rrb
