imyo was exposed in jordan by jordanian authorities on august when the jordanian security bodies confiscated weapons and ammunition the organization had been hiding in jordan to be used to destablize the regime and security in the country during the trials this organization tried to claim that the weapons found by the authorities were temporarily hidden in jordan but were to be smuggled into the occupied territories and given to the palestinian strugglers there to enhance their ability to confront the zionist forces and carry out military operations against them the imyo also claimed that the weapons that were found were not brought in from any neighboring country but were purchased on the local market at the time two members of parliament were arrested ya qub qirrish anbd layth shubaylat on chrages of heading the organization the security information the investigators have collected on the al ma ayitah assassination shows that as soon as the imyo was exposed jordanian fundamentalist elements belonging to various organizations such as muhammad s army the islamic liberation army and the imyo and others moved to neighboring arab countries most of the factions left for lebanon where they found the suitable atmosphere and the appropriate place to carry out their activities in cooperation with hizballah the information gathered also shows that some jordanian fundamentalist elements moved to iran where they received training courses in the al quds camp and the kermandi lsb name as transliterated rsb camp and courses in intelligence work in the darjah lsb name as transliterated rsb institute iran has sponsored these organizations to establish islamic organizations and cells in the countries that have common borders with israel so they can take power in these countries and turn them into islamic regimes since that time iran exploited the elements from these fundamentalist organizations and established the jordan office in the liberation movement s office ayatollah shakhiry lsb name as transliterated rsb the official in charge of the jordan section in the iranian intelligence organ took charge of this office confirmed information indicates that in early imyo elements held an important meeting in amsterdam the netherlands with officials from the frc the official in charge of the jordanian elements was shakir abu jami a jordanian national wanted by authorities in his country and one of the most prominent members of the jordanian fundamentalist muhammad army organization abu jami now lives in sa dah yemen which is home to camps for afghan and arab fundamentalists the information adds that the imyo made several decisions to attack jordanian interests and institutions and assassinate jordanian diplomats in a move to pressure the jordanian regime the information says that the scheme was designed some two years ago and the muslim brotherhood movement in jordan refused to get involved in it because of the danger and because the brotherhood movement does not agree with the proposals of other fundamentalist organizations iran managed to recruit frc members to work in the jordanian fundamentalist extremist organizations by taking advantage of the hostility the abu nidal group has harbored against jordan and its regime and king ever since the group was expelled from the country the information confirms that abu nidal group s leadership agreed to execute the mission for the aforesaid reasons because of its commitment to the policy of extremism and rejection that aims at torpedoing the lsb peace rsb process and because of its ties to iran within the framework of international terrorism detailing this cooperation that lead to al ma ayitah s assassination the security sources note that the al ramlah al bayda area in beirut contained a secret headquarters for walid khalid the frc official spokesman who was assassinated in the lebanese capital on july these meetings were conducted in the presence of an frc official called amjad ata a lebanese member of abu nidal group named tha ir and a jordanian imyo official from the idkaydik family the plan to assassinate al ma ayitah was drafted during these meetings but why did the abu nidal group and the imyo choose to assassinate na ib al ma ayitah and not any other jordanian official in the beirut embassy to carry out the assassination an intensive training course was conducted for the palestinians bassam atiyah and yusuf adwani in a secret center run by abu nidal group in buq atah in lebanon s al shuf area under the supervision of a palestinian expert in assassinations called a al umayri lsb not further identified rsb al umayri was implicated in the assassination of the frc official bahij abu al hana in july in lebanon s al biqa area after he accused him of contacting the arafat led fatah movement confirmed security information says a jordanian fundamentalist took part in the assassination of al ma ayitah he was charged with observation and backup when the assassination was carried out the man is called khalid al bishtawi years old the security agencies information suggests that al bishtawi fled to burj al barajinah camp after the crime and then moved to cyprus where he joined jordanian fundamentalist elements living there with tunisian fundamentalists from the rachid ghanouchi led al nahdah movement the frc lrb abu nidal group rrb took immediate steps after al ma ayitah s assassination it made changes within the ranks of its officials and moved some of them outside lebanon and changed the secret apartments it owns in beirut and the southern part of sidon it is worth noting that the jordanian intelligence service played an important role in revealing the secrets and details of al ma ayitah s assassination jordanian security officials traveled to lebanon and cooperated with lebanese officers in the investigations that led to revealing all the details and the arrest of more than members of abu nidal group in jordan it seems that the investigations will not stop at this point in beirut or amman in an apparent attempt to prevent the revelation of further details the leadership of the abu nidal group urged king husayn to give it a chance to explain its position it also hastened to send one of its officials to lebanon to follow the investigation and try to lessen its repercussions out of fear that al ma ayitah s assassination may be one of the fatal mistakes committed by the frc and may negatively affect the organization s future in lebanon and jordan
