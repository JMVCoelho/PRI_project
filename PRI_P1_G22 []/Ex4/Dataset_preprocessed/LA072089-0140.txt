a crippled united airlines dc crashed a half mile short of a runway while trying to make an emergency landing wednesday afternoon bursting into a cartwheeling fireball that broke into what one eyewitness described as pieces and killing at least of the passengers and crew members on board remarkably as many as persons survived the violent crash according to richard vohs a spokesman for iowa gov terry e branstad the fate of four others was not immediately known tail engine explodes the plane s tail engine exploded before the crash but it was not immediately clear how the explosion contributed to what a federal aviation administration spokesman called complete hydraulic failure an occurrence regarded as extremely rare in the wide bodied dc which has three independent hydraulic systems that operate all the plane s control surfaces on its wings and tail and landing gear and brakes as rescuers worked underneath floodlights to remove bodies from the crash site original estimates of the death toll one as high as which would have made the crash the second worst in u s history were reduced we do n t have a firm count of the dead vohs acknowledged at a press conference seven hours after the crash but right now the number lrb of survivors rrb confirmed is the survivors of wednesday s united flight from denver to philadelphia via chicago included several dozen passengers who managed to walk out of a dark smoke filled upside down section of the jet after it broke off and came to rest in a tall cornfield off the runway i walked out lrb through the back of the plane rrb and found myself in the cornfield passenger david landsberger told cable news network we were all walking around in shock i just walked through it like it was a dream i was a little dazed it s the goddamndest thing i ever saw in my life said charles mertz of castle rock colo another of those who walked away suitcases paper mail clothes chunks of burning metal and bodies were strewn over the inactive runway at sioux gateway airport where the plane crashed after desperately circling for a half hour one hundred ambulances fire trucks and helicopters from as far away as south dakota plucked out the victims the search for bodies was difficult because some of them were scattered in the cornfield many of the survivors were listed in critical condition with burns or broken bones united airlines declined to comment on the number of survivors or to release the names of the passengers and crew members eyewitnesses said pieces of the year old airplane one of the oldest airliners in united s fleet were falling off as far as miles from the site of the crash a team of national transportation safety board investigators left washington wednesday night for sioux city the hydraulic system that disintegrated wednesday works the same way a power steering system operates in a car by forcing liquid through a tube the system provides enough power for a pilot to move an airliner s huge tail rudder and elevators and wing panels known as flaps and ailerons all needed to steer an aircraft some aviation experts speculating on why flight crashed after completing less than half of its scheduled mile trip to chicago suggested that the explosion of the tail engine sent shards of metal through the tail section somehow destroying common lines that serve the three hydraulic systems there were reports from passengers and observers that the plane s right wing engine also failed before the crash in what survivors described as a heroic effort that nearly succeeded the plane s seattle based captain a c haynes a year veteran of the airline who along with the other crew members survived the crash struggled for a half hour to maintain control of the wobbling plane radio transmission indicated the plane s maneuverability was limited to right hand turns at one point haynes attempted a landing on highway near cushing iowa but chose not to touch down there in favor of trying to make sioux city a farming and livestock center of in the northwest corner of iowa along the missouri river preparing for crash landing then they said we were preparing for a crash landing they said it would be about seconds but it was about five minutes another passenger said haynes brought the plane into the airport s foot long southwest runway surrounded by corn soybeans and pasture with some trees seven miles outside downtown sioux city at about p m cdt the plane made its final approach onlookers watched hopefully we thought it was going to make it said glen olson city editor of the sioux city journal it did n t shortly before touchdown the plane s right wing began to dip and the nose began to fall the wing hit the ground a half mile before the runway the impact caused the aircraft to turn over several times as it slid down the runway breaking up very badly catching on fire and then exploding according to bob raynesford an faa spokesman i think it turned over a couple of times i think it landed upside down said passenger melanie cincala of toledo ohio who said the plane burst into flames after she got off a large piece of the fuselage barreled onto the runway huge clouds of smoke and flames billowed upward as firemen sprayed foam over the wreckage rescue helicopters hovered overhead we were sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with smoke said cliff marshall of columbus ohio who was returning home from denver push little girl out then god opened a hole in the basement lrb the bottom of the plane rrb and i pushed a little girl out i grabbed another kept pulling them out until they did n t come no more marshall said he thought he helped a half dozen out and then he ran dr romaine bendixen clinic commander of iowa national guard s th tactical fighter group said he was the first doctor on the scene about three minutes after the crash he had just landed in another plane he said the living were scattered among the dead in one group of six seats a woman sitting in the middle was barely injured her husband beside her was dead and two behind her were dead bendixen said he said rescuers pulled out three of the flight crew alive hewitt graham manager of graham flying service a charter service and corporate aircraft maintenance firm that operates out of the building closest to the crash site said he was in his office answering phones when five crash victims a man his wife and young son and two other men walked in it was amazing they were in remarkably good shape from looking at one or two of them you would n t know they were in the accident graham said their clothes were clean not mussed their hair was in place and they had no scratches he could see he said survival rate remarkable c o miller former chief investigator for the national transportation safety board said the crash s survival rate was remarkable and was probably the result of the pilot s ability to maneuver the plane close to the ground before losing complete control if an airplane cartwheels it is very fortuitous that anybody got out said miller now a private aviation safety consultant in sidona ariz he said the huge mass of the dc must have helped the pilot slow the plane as it approached the ground and helped keep portions of it intact he said a smaller plane such as a dc would have been far more likely to break up more severely st luke s regional medical center said to crash victims had been admitted and of those were expected to leave the hospital wednesday night a spokesman said they sustained light injuries about survivors were housed overnight at briarcliff college lavonne quirin of alta in buena vista county miles from the airport said she and her husband found a cone shaped section of the plane in a cornfield at their seed corn business size of a car it s about the size of a car she said she said no one at the farm saw or heard the object fall mcdonnell douglas corp which builds the dc said the plane was delivered to united in united the nation s second largest airline has one of the oldest fleets in the industry the average age of its aircraft is years the average for the entire industry is years no unusual weather was reported wind speeds were clocked up to m p h a dc was involved in the nation s worst air crash years ago on may american airlines flight lost an engine on takeoff banked sideways out of control slammed into a field and exploded all passengers and crew members died as well as two people on the ground the national transportation safety board cited maintenance induced damage a inch crack in the engine mount that caused the left engine to tear loose the ntsb also criticized mcdonnell douglas design as vulnerable to maintenance damage mcdonnell douglas suspended production of the dc airliner in dc orders collapsed in because of the recession and the may crash in all dc s were produced wednesday s tragedy was the worst in a recent series of accidents and mishaps involving united nine persons were hurled to their deaths last feb when a cargo door popped open in flight tearing a gaping hole in a united boeing jetliner the cause of that accident which took place over the pacific near hawaii is under investigation turns up deficiencies the accident probe has turned up deficiencies in united s procedures regarding the cargo doors the airline told ntsb investigators that it had somehow overlooked an faa recommendation to inspect the cargo door latch locks each time the door is closed manually rather than electrically on july a united boeing was forced to make an emergency landing at miami international airport after the plane was damaged in heavy turbulence over the florida georgia border none of the airliner s passengers were injured on tuesday a united dc with people aboard slid yards on the runway after landing at rain soaked o hare international airport in chicago but there were no injuries last dec a united dc bound for chicago with passengers had engine problems after takeoff and dumped gallons of fuel over the pacific before returning safely to los angeles the second worst crash in u s history was an aug crash that killed
