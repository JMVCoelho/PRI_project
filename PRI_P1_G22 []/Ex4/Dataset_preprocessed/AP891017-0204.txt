the major earthquake that struck the san francisco bay area tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in northern california a report by the u s geological survey placed the probability of an earthquake of magnitude on the richter scale at percent by the year in the southern santa cruz mountains the high probability is based on several factors including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in said clarence allen professor of geology and geophysics at the california institue of technology in pasadena this is not to say we predicted the earthquake it just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area allen said he noted that the report titled probabilities of large earthquakes occurring in california on the san andreas fault presented information that was already widely known among scientists allen said this information should have alerted officials to take preventive steps frank baldwin of u s geological survey s earthquake center said the quake s magnitude was on the richter scale it was centered in the santa cruz calif area miles south of san francico the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs a reading of can cause severe damage a quake of magnitude a major earthquake is capable of widespread heavy damage initial reports indicated widespread damage from tuesday s quake especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings it s not like an earthquake of this size in this area is a calamitous event it s something we should therefore be ready for allen said the damage in the bay area occurred to the same kind of structures heavily damaged in the whittier quake in the los angeles area which registered a richter reading allen said i think we ll learn a lot from an engineering point of view from this earthquake he said what will be important is to see how the modern structures behaved allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that appeared to have been damaged in san francisco also exist in the los angeles region in addition some of the roadways and overpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of construction as the bay bridge in some areas of southern california there is a higher probability of a major quake occurring the highest the usgs says is in the central california town of parkfield where there is a percent probability of a magnitude earthquake by the year
