more than of police chiefs and sheriffs surveyed agree that criminals are not affected by a ban on any type of firearm while more than oppose waiting periods for the same reason a prisoner survey conducted by james d wright et al found that unarmed felons listed tougher penalties for using a gun as an important reason for not arming themselves of u s violent crimes are committed by career criminals many on some form of conditional or early release lrb of career criminals are rearrested with previous criminal charges still pending rrb gary kleck found that using a gun for protection from violent crime rape robbery assault reduces the likelihood that the crime will be completed and that intended victims will be injured clearly the issue at hand is not gun control but rather crime control according to mr gartner this year about teen agers will use handguns to kill themselves some adults will do the same suicides are without doubt tragic events affecting parents families and society is how these people killed themselves the real issue or is why more important the unfortunate truth is that if a person is desperate or depressed enough to commit suicide he will find a way to do it guns or no guns the most important fact of all must not be overlooked criminals do n t care about gun control laws they never have and they never will frank t iorio mamaroneck n y as a life member of the national rifle association i agree with mr gartner it is not too much to ask for a nationwide seven day cooling off period lrb the brady bill rrb to give the authorities time for background checks as a law abiding citizen it would be of comfort to know that other potential handgun buyers would be screened and keep those with a criminal past from owning a handgun the reason washington has yet to enact serious gun control laws is due to the enormous voting and financial pressure of the pro gun lobby while congress is congratulating itself on how well it acted during the vote on the persian gulf war more than body bags were filled here in the u s due to handgun violence the nra has not acted prudently and is alienating the support and respect of many legislators police departments and its members james forbes atlanta it is refreshing to read the actual motives of those who claim they simply want a waiting period for the purchase of a handgun mr gartner has now made it abundantly clear that his goal is the elimination of handguns from our society i find it incongruous that the president of nbc news a man who should believe in the broadening of constitutional rights obviously has no regard for the second amendment rights to keep and bear arms i am sure that if there were a movement to narrow and restrict the first amendment freedoms of the press he would be at the forefront of the opposition mr gartner ignores the key issues regarding suicide and crime the problem is not the instrument used to kill oneself or someone else the problems are the breakdown of the family lrb black and white rrb an education system that fails to educate poverty illegal drugs and emasculated police justice and penal systems this has been the message preached by the nra for years as evidenced by new york city and washington which have the nation s strictest gun control laws and virtually ban the ownership of handguns by law abiding citizens mr gartner s placebo does n t work because it ignores the root causes of suicide and crime richard w bonds cordova tenn mr gartner should have read the federalist no by james madison before he wrote his anti gun diatribe if he had he would understand that the constitutional guarantee of uninfringed firearms possession is for protection against tyranny it has nothing to do with duck hunting or target shooting furthermore madison makes it clear that state militias by the fact of their being organized would give private arms their greatest effectiveness in the resistance to tyranny otherwise in the words of alexander hamilton the citizens must rush tumultuously to arms without concert without system without resource except in their courage and despair thus the well organized militia phrase in the second amendment was not intended to restrict arms to those in the militia as the anti gun lobby would have us believe when we realize that the individual right to keep and bear arms is our ultimate defense against tyranny all of the arguments about magazine capacity armor piercing bullets sporting use etc suddenly stand before us in their naked falsity robert m beckett fountain valley calif
