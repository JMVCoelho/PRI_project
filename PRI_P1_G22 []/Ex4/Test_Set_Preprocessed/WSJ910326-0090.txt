mr kelley is in training for the boston marathon his th boston marathon and even at the age of he probably will finish ahead of a large number of the runners expected to compete officially or unofficially on april bill rodgers a four time boston marathon winner who plans to run again this year marvels at mr kelley it s incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he s doing i m struggling at the age of this is n t golf even the thought of running a course of miles and yards leaves some of mr kelley s rivals of yesteryear gasping aghast is more like it says leslie pawson a three time boston champion who ran against mr kelley half a century ago my doctor says no running whatsoever i ca n t even remember when i ran my last marathon john adelbert kelley is a throwback to a time when marathoners did it for glory and cab fare a two time winner in boston lrb and rrb and runner up seven times mr kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year as he has been for years mr kelley is such an institution that hopkinton mass where the race begins has made him an honorary citizen lrb that means i do n t have to pay taxes there he jokes rrb two state troopers will run alongside the foot pound mr kelley into boston so he wo n t be trampled by groupies as he calls them clamoring to shake his hand last year five japanese runners were waved away by the bodyguards as they sidled up to the old celebrity during the race recalls suni tomomitsu one of the runners at first we thought oh wow he s like mafia man then we said oh no this is nice johnny kelley in japan he is awesome though he is n t the oldest person ever to enter the boston marathon mr kelley is the oldest to run it peter foley who was born in was a regular until he was well into his s but he walked the course starting at dawn lrb six hours before the official noon start rrb mr foley would eventually saunter across the finish line in the moonlight of course mr kelley not to be confused with the other john kelley who won the boston marathon in is n t the runner he was in when he won the race in hours minutes seconds his best time ever was in hours minutes seconds last year he finished in hours minutes he hopes to do better in that s not a prediction just a goal he says when john kelley first toed the line in george bush was n t yet in kindergarten joe dimaggio was an unknown and nike was the winged goddess of victory not a running shoe in those days mr kelley recalls he ran in black leather high jumping shoes that he cut open at the toes with a razor blade i would have loved to run with the worst pair of sneakers on the market today he says back then the sport did n t have much of a following today of course the boston marathon is a big deal covered by tv from start to finish and offering altogether in prize money the winners get a medal and says mr kelley i got a medal and beef stew god bless them he adds they deserve it the rosy cheeked supple mr kelley is a medical wonder each year he visits the cooper clinic at the aerobics center in dallas for a battery of endurance tests physiologically whatever that means i got all a s mr kelley reports of his checkup four months ago what that means explains kenneth cooper the physician who wrote aerobics and several sequels and is now at work on a book on elderly athletes is that johnny has the body of a man years younger he s going to be one of the stars of my book mr kelley s resting pulse rate beats a minute is well below the average person s beats lrb that s good rrb on the stress test the clinic gives mr kelley holds the endurance record for his age group a mechanic for boston edison co before he retired in mr kelley started running in the evenings after work more than six decades ago his only purpose was to relax and have some fun all day long i did what my boss told me to do he recalls but when i ran at night i felt free i ran till i was exhausted in when he was he entered his first boston marathon but did n t finish he dropped out three quarters of the way through the race then in he finished th in a field of about runners in all the years since he has missed the race just once in lrb he has competed all told in marathons including the and olympics mr kelley well knows the jagged course from hopkinton to downtown boston the first challenge comes five miles into the race where a set of little hills can get a psyched runner to waste energy charging up the slopes a mile and a half later there s new reason to beware the smells of cavanaugh s bakery can set off hunger pangs an exxon station in wellesley marks the halfway point a steep descent into newton lower falls can jar a tired runner s bones then at the end of a long column of oak and maple trees is heartbreak hill his nemesis it cost him at least two victories he says and finally there s the haunted mile a stretch where many runners have collapsed boston s skyline miles in the distance can seem so far away though still going strong mr kelley acknowledges the marathon gets tougher each year to compensate he trains harder he used to start preparing in earnest at the end of january in recent years i ve been in training months a year he says though the serious stuff a daily one hour run sprints on the track and long hour runs every other week begins in december lrb he does n t count the miles he puts in as many long distance runners obsessively do but he says he would n t object to an estimate of about miles a week rrb mr kelley always trains at a m and alone it s a quiet time no traffic the air is fresh and sweet his routes vary in january he prefers the frozen sands of the beach with the approach of spring he takes to the alder and scrub pine hills and bluffs where the sun can be seen rising over cape cod bay after his morning run he spends a couple of hours painting lrb still lifes and cape cod scenes rrb a hobby he took up about years ago unlike many runners mr kelley does n t bother with stretching exercises before he runs in the morning this is my warm up i empty the dishwasher i set up the coffeepot but i do n t plug it in i set up the breakfast table then i check the outside temperature to see what clothes to wear he and his wife laura live in a two bedroom ranch style house here in east dennis with more than trophies medals and sweat stained marathon numbers scattered about he is n t particular about brands of shoes lrb i wear them all rrb or what he eats lrb i never eat broccoli but i love steak and ice cream rrb mr kelley aims to run till he is at least years old he s a strange man says laura kelley in awe of her husband s vigor the year old mrs kelley adds i just try to stay in his shadow but i have a hard time even doing that in a rare moment of reflection mr kelley explains what makes him tick i paint because i like it i run because i like it if for some reason i do n t finish the marathon i do n t owe an apology to anyone but i ll tell you the boston marathon with all those people waving is better than my birthday
