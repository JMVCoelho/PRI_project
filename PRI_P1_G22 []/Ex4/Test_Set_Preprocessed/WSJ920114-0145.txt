mr goldwin s mistake stems from his having confused a necessary with a sufficient condition the second amendment in its language and its history makes plain that the need for a well regulated militia is a sufficient condition for the right to keep and bear arms yet mr goldwin treats it as a necessary condition which enables him to conclude that congress could deny an individual the right to own a gun if he did not join the national guard mr goldwin makes this mistake in turn because he has misread madison s original version of the second amendment which exempted conscientious objectors from military service thus he says that in this version bearing arms must mean to render military service or why else would there have to be an exemption for religious reasons what right must not be infringed the right of the people to serve in the militia plainly any conscientious objector provision would arise not from a right but from a duty to serve in the militia yet mr goldwin believes the amendment means as he later says that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in the militia thus does he reduce the first of these rights to the second when clearly it is much broader roger pilon senior fellow and director center for constitutional studies cato institute washington the militia is not the national guard but rather the people of the original states in ohio we have an ohio militia that is not a part of the national guard the fear of standing armies and the control these armed men gave a central government was foremost in the framers minds when writing the bill of rights thomas jefferson moved to prevent this type of power in a few people s hands by the second amendment he stated no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms the addition in the early drafts of a conscientious objector clause was added for the preservation of religious freedoms which the colonists had not had in england it is unfortunate today s scholars seem to spend their time picking apart history and the great thoughts of the visionary men who formed this country in my personal celebration of this year old document i have pledged the following i will give up my freedom of speech when they cut out my tongue i will give up my right to worship when they have slain my god and myself i will assemble with the people of my choice even when they are imprisoned and i will give up my rifle when they pry my cold dead fingers from around it samuel r bush iii cincinnati let those who want guns join the national guard says mr goldwin ah the sanctimonious arrogance of it what gives mr goldwin the right to deny mine when i abide by the laws he stresses the differences between the world of and today to suit his prejudice he studiously ignores other major differences between and today in punishment was swifter and surer plea bargaining was not epidemic judges did not provide revolving doors on prisons there was no army of drug dealers and junkies preying on the public if anything the reasons for citizens to own weapons for self defense are more compelling today than they were in let mr goldwin show us how he would make us safer in our homes and we might understand his wish to strip away our only sure defense carl roessler san francisco mr goldwin s article is a casebook example of convoluted logic consider that george mason lrb rrb the great virginia constitutionalist defined quite clearly the meaning of the word militia during a debate in i ask who are the militia he said and then answered his own question with the words they consist now of the whole people lrb emphasis added rrb mason s credentials are reliable he is the author of the first amendments to our constitution lcb there is a debate about who actually drafted the amendments mason or madison rcb further a u s law defined the militia as not only the national guard but all able bodied males between and i along with millions of other americans am not against sensible gun control i e licensing character searches etc what i resent is mr goldwin s agenda which is removal of all guns from american citizens through the implementation of total regulations a direct violation of the second amendment through nefarious means edward f menninger sterling heights mich mr goldwin suggests gun control via enlistment in the national guard swell idea updating the right to bear arms from to when i report for service i ll bring as required a few items consistent with the current infantryman s inventory a barett light semiautomatic sniper rifle so i can reach out and touch people half a mile away a squad automatic weapon firing mm rounds at the rate of a whole lot per second out of round clips or hundred round belts a mm grenade launcher but you get the idea then as a thoroughly modern well regulated militiaman i ll take my weapons home just as did morgan s riflemen and the musket bearers of lexington and concord and the colonial light artillerists andrew l isaac canterbury n h
