in his state of the union address last january president reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years he instructed his charges to draw up plans for immediate action that would enable poor families to achieve real and lasting emancipation from welfare dependency the success of welfare he said should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare the president s convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti poverty programs with little apparent abatement in poverty the president correctly sensed that the public wants reform if the president lets up on welfare reform he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last january a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is to build on the momentum he created a year ago the president must make plain his commitment in the state of the union message next tuesday to pull away now would be to undercut the welfare reform movement just as it has hit its stride the president ought to challenge congress to respond to his initiatives his domestic policy council has drafted a blueprint it would give the states wider latitude to experiment with welfare programs many of the governors seem to like the plan as they have already unveiled their own proposals for welfare reform the president and the governors should be natural allies on this issue and the chances of success would be enhanced if they could jointly commit themselves to a plan of action the president will need all the help he can get if he is to convince democrats in congress to go along most have paid lip service to the idea of welfare reform but nary a bill has been put on the docket this suggests that the democrats are n t as serious about welfare reform as the governors and the american public are there is a reason for this the democrats have long been beholden to the welfare lobby whose interests now have less to do with alleviating poverty than with enlarging the welfare bureaucracy this past december a coalition of some organizations most with headquarters in washington issued a statement of principles calling for increased spending for poverty and jobs programs it also insisted that the federal government has primary responsibility for operating welfare congressional democrats seem to be in agreement with the welfare lobby however the public wants the system changed it will be difficult for congress to sell restored or additional spending on current poverty programs when the american people are already spending more than billion a year on these programs the president should take up his case for reform directly with the american people with the alliance of reform minded governors and the support of the public the president can press congress to move off the deadening status quo with the ball in its court congress can decide either to work with the president and the governors or it can continue to place the interests of the welfare lobby ahead of the interests of the poor
