there are two solid reasons for congressional term limitation that economists at least those of the public choice persuasion should fully appreciate first the less time that a politician spends inside the beltway the less his or her common sense will be corrupted by the culture of ruling that exists there to have microphones pushed in your face every day and to be asked your opinion on everything under the sun is a corrupting influence soon you start thinking your opinion is more important than it really is and worse that perhaps you should codify your opinion on everything under the sun other than this corruption of common sense for instance what could explain congress s attempt to repeal the laws of economics through federal deposit insurance second term limits end the adverse pre selection process that exists whereby most individuals seeking office today actually find the prospect of spending the rest of their lives in washington d c attractive such individuals are the last ones we should want passing laws governing the rest of us what congress needs is experience in living in the real world not in passing legislation today business people teachers computer programmers and other productive citizens look at the prospect of running for congress and recognize that they must be willing to commit or years of their lives to being politicians if they expect to have any legislative influence they opt not to run with six year limits in the house lrb which most term limit initiatives are now proposing for state congressional delegations rrb such individuals would recognize that they would immediately be on a par with their colleagues in congress and that they would not have to give up their productive careers in the private sector in order to serve indeed a true citizen congress would consist of legislators who view their time there as essentially a leave of absence from their real jobs certainly the composition of congress under term limitation would reflect something other than men and lawyers as it does now seventy five percent of americans support term limitation everyone from ralph nader to milton friedman because they recognize it as an opportunity for citizens to wrest control of government from an impervious congress full of check bouncing power lusting professional politicians edward h crane president cato institute washington
