thus began another chapter in one of medicine s most bizarre mysteries a tale of sick sheep and mad cows cannibals and pennsylvanians ancient life forms and a cat named max the plot revolves around a family of brain diseases probably variations of a single disorder called spongiform encephalopathy it is infectious invariably fatal and as insidious as termites sometimes eating away brain cells for years without detection before a critical mass is spongified then over a few months motor control buckles and cognition crumbles victims then die quickly usually within a year now after decades of detective work medical sleuths appear to be closing in on the molecular culprits behind the disease their dogged pursuit wo n t nail a public health enemy no the disease is rare but it may pay off in a big way because the findings could shed light on more common killers including alzheimer s disease the work also promises basic science breakthroughs spongiform research already has raised questions about a cornerstone of biology and spawned a nobel prize the uncanny nature of the disorder sometimes grips scientists with a kind of obsessive fascination notes nih researcher d carleton gajdusek he should know having chased spongiform leads around the globe for years and won a nobel prize in the process recently the fascination has taken on a more anxious cast as the disease has struck humans and animals with suspicious regularity in several places underscoring a longstanding question do people get the disease from animals the question has burned with special intensity since scrapie the form of the disease in sheep jumped to british cattle a few years ago after they were fed ground up parts of infected sheep about british cattle have been destroyed since in hopes of eradicating the spongiform mad cow disease which makes the animals jittery before they keel over a few weeks ago the first confirmed case of mad cow disease outside britain turned up in switzerland u s meat producers have reason to be anxious about this because the incidence of scrapie has been rising in american sheep since the mid s says richard marsh a university of wisconsin scrapie expert scientists agree however that the disease in animals probably poses little danger to people scrapie has existed for centuries and the world is bathed in its infectious agent says dr gajdusek yet sheep have never been strongly implicated in cases of the human form of the disease creutzfeldt jakob disease or cjd at least not until the poltar journalist and two other people died of cjd at about the same time in a rural sheep herding part of eastern czechoslovakia when dr mitrova a researcher at a bratislava medical institute heard of the unusual cluster of cases she decided to investigate from the first one clue stood out like a bloodstain almost all of the people are involved in raising and taking care of sheep she says the local cuisine includes a soup of sheep meat stewed in sheep milk the area s equivalent of chicken soup for colds is sheep brain fried in onions one cjd victim even slept with a pet sheep until age now such coincidences seem like a serial killer s pattern against all odds cjd has struck again and again in the same region called slovakia times since mainly grouped in two areas the outbreak has become something of an epidemic around the orava area where cases have occurred since a rate hundreds of times higher than normal for cjd residents of the affected areas are very afraid says dr mitrova she has found evidence of scrapie in the area s sheep now villagers there call cjd our sheep disease that s a leap of folklore though and the sheep link may well turn out to be false cautions dr mitrova indeed cjd is a nefarious trickster the first reported case of the disease which entered medical texts in the s really was n t cjd after all scientists now believe and it usually strikes so rarely and randomly killing about one in a million people world wide each year that scientists did n t even begin to suspect it was infectious until that year the nih s dr gajdusek then a young scientist casting about for big questions planned a trip to papua new guinea to visit a friend he never arrived en route he heard that a primitive new guinea tribe the fore were dying in droves from an unknown brain disorder they called kuru the shivering disease because it started with tremors fascinated he dropped everything plunged into the backwoods with a local doctor and took charge of investigating the affair to the great annoyance of australian authorities then overseeing the area gajdusek has an intelligence quotient up in the s and the emotional immaturity of a year old one of his mentors warned the australians in a letter and wo n t let danger physical difficulty or other people s feelings interfere in the least with what he wants to do in short he was perfect for the job soon kuru victims brains started issuing from the heart of darkness to distant medical centers compliments of dr gajdusek he swapped axes and salt for autopsy rights dissecting one victim with a carving knife by lantern light in a native hut during a howling storm according to his letters home he and the local doctor vincent zigas tried everything from tranquilizers to hormones on kuru patients nothing helped the cause remained elusive two years later william hadlow a u s veterinarian saw a picture of one of the kuru brains in a medical journal and was struck by its spongy appearance he had seen that look before in scrapie the sheep disease and put in a call to the nih another link fell into place when igor klatzo an nih scientist noticed kuru brains resembled ones from cjd victims based on the clues dr gajdusek back at nih led studies in the s showing kuru cjd and scrapie to be essentially the same infectious disease studies that won the nobel prize for medicine the discoveries confirmed a long suspected connection the kuru outbreak sprang from a fore mourning ritual in which relatives ate their deceased kin s lightly cooked and often kuru infected brains but the infectious agent continued to baffle scientists it somehow could hide in the brain for decades without causing the usual signs of infection such as fever brain tissue of infected animals could transmit the disease when injected into different animals brains yet microscopes revealed no signs of infectious microbes and why did the agent sporadically appear in people with no known exposure it seemed like biological spontaneous combustion says nih researcher paul brown in the early s scientists discovered that cjd like alzheimer s disease often gums up the brain with a kind of junk or amyloid protein further studies showed the junk mainly contains a botched form of a naturally occurring brain protein sometimes called a prion many scientists now believe it s the culprit but their theory entails a biologically weird premise that the altered protein replicates itself without the aid of genetic material the basis of all known reproduction if they re right such self replicating proteins might be representatives of an ancient twilight zone between life and nonlife evolution s bridge between molecules and microbes when formed in a brain cell a molecule of such stuff might be like a bad apple in a barrel converting all the other apples says the nih s dr brown a hot question does the amyloid in alzheimer s disease form similarly all this however does n t explain what happened after dr brown baked isolates of the disease agent for an hour at degrees fahrenheit a temperature that melts proteins he injected the ashy residue into animals brains expecting nothing to happen but a few of them got spongiform disease he also buried isolates in his garden for three years and found they remained infectious the results may be very disquieting he says to british farmers who have been burning and burying mad cow corpses still dr brown and other scientists are n t much worried about mad cows because their animal studies show spongiform disease is very hard to transmit orally eating huge doses of the agent is required perhaps the mad cows got such doses every time they went to the feedbag says dr brown kuru victims apparently consumed similar mega doses and so may have max he was a siamese cat in bristol england that died last spring examining his brain a veterinarian found a telltale sponginess sparking another round of panic in the u k about spongiform disease now more than british cats have died of it suggesting brains from infected sheep or cows got into cat food meanwhile yet another spongiform outbreak has occurred this time among northeastern pennsylvanians the cluster of more than a dozen cjd cases is n t an epidemic and appears to have topped out in says brian little an allentown neuropathologist leading a study of it but it is worrisome because like the slovakian outbreak it suggests a common underlying cause that could strike again during the past few months the nih team working with dr mitrova has found a thread that for the first time may link many such cjd cases the discovery began when the scientists ferreted out a genetic defect in two u s brothers who had died of cjd in itself that was nothing new scientists have long known that cjd runs in some families and therefore suspected a genetic problem but dr brown s excitement grew when three other unrelated cjd victims were found to carry the same genetic defect on a flyer he says i called relatives of the victims and struck gold they were all of eastern european descent suggesting people of similar ancestry might carry the gene drs brown and gajdusek knew just where to look for such people they grabbed a plane for czechoslovakia since then the team has confirmed that many of the slovakian cjd victims and a cluster of libyan born jews whose tissues were preserved carried the defect the findings suggest one of two things either the defect alone produces the deadly agent or it predisposes its carriers to get cjd when they are exposed to the agent the findings have opened the door for early diagnosis and possible prevention of cjd but they also have introduced a new riddle says dr gajdusek why has the genetic defect which has apparently existed for decades in some eastern europeans turned deadly only in the past years or so essentially we re stuck with another paradox he adds but there s nothing else worth working on in science
