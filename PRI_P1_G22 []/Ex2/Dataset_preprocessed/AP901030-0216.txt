britain and france were linked beneath the english channel on tuesday when workers used a two inch probe to connect two halves of a mile undersea rail tunnel officials reported management sources at transmanche link the construction consortium building the chunnel the channel tunnel confirmed the historic linkup occurred about p m when british workers sent the probe through to french colleagues it is an example of what europe is about british prime minister margaret thatcher said in london this is europe in practice the linkup fulfills a dream by napoleon in who thought he could defeat the english by connecting britain to europe with a land passage the chunnel is scheduled for completion in june this is a hugely historic moment because it means in effect that britain is no longer an island said a construction union official eight workers suffered injuries two seriously about minutes later when a tractor towing supplies rolled over on them in a service gallery authorities in nearby sangatte reported the basic goal of the channel tunnel project is to enable passengers to travel between london and paris in about three hours that time is comparable to flying if transport to and from airports is included and is half the time of a car ferry journey the conservative daily express newspaper noted in its wednesday editions that britons would theoretically be able to walk to france for the first time since the last ice age the cost of the project has soared from an initial estimate of billion to billion including an extra billion for unforeseen cost overruns the threading of the probes through yards of chalk under the english channel marks a major turning point in three years of drilling on the world s costliest tunnel the meeting point was just over lcb miles southeast of shakespeare cliff the british terminus near the town of dover and miles northwest of the french town of sangatte near calais the tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side accounting for its total length of miles geological conditions account for the different progress on each side french workers reaching the tiny hole telephoned their british counterparts and relayed the news to transmanche officials the first champagne corks popped minutes later it s an exciting moment it s the first time we have air passing between the two tunnels said gordon crighton tunnel engineering manager we see it as just another exercise but i m sure there will be a lot of parties going on he said preliminary tests indicated the two halves were inches out of alignment another day will be needed to be certain technicians said but they called the line up exceptional considering the massive boring machines are drilling holes about three stories high the workers will now bore out a one yard hole to permit passage from one half to the other they are expected to greet each other with handshakes in a few weeks two japanese designed boring machines are drilling the tunnel after it is finished one will be dismantled and hauled out in pieces the other will drill its own grave and be buried in cement because french officials said it will be too costly to extricate it a work slowdown since last week by militant tunnelers demanding more pay on the french side appeared likely monday to stall the linkup until the weekend or beyond but transmanche officials said earlier tuesday that the meeting in the middle would occur on schedule the chunnel actually consists of three tunnels two for railway trains and a smaller maintenance tunnel between them taking into account all the tunnels percent of the drilling has been completed by giant japanese built boring machines working from calais and folkstone england tuesday s linkup in the service tunnel is described by the french as a mouse ole a bore only two inches in diameter president francois mitterrand and mrs thatcher are expected to meet each other in the tunnel jan after the digging for much of the tunnel is finished the first coupling of the two rail tunnels is scheduled for mid eurotunnel plc the world s largest engineering project announced oct that it had reached an agreement with its banks on billion in new credit more than banks are involved in the financing the chunnel s scheduled debut in mid would come six months after the nation european community formally drops remaining trade barriers becoming a unified marketplace of million consumers officials estimate the tunnel may carry million passengers in the first year of operation although eurotunnel does n t expect a profit until the end of the century a study released last friday in paris by transportation experts said the tunnel s completion will aggravate traffic congestion in a wide area of continental europe some britons have worries of a different sort fearing an influx of ills from the continent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals since construction began in late there have been seven deaths on the british side and two on the french five british firms were ordered last wednesday to stand trial on charges related to the death of a construction worker last year the undersea bond between the two hereditary enemies was envisioned nearly years ago by a french engineer called albert mathieu napoleon wanted to build it but britain warned him off tunneling actually started in subsequent efforts in and but were abandoned
