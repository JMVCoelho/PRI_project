in blood red letters the sign on the front window of the dealers outlet gun store in suburban phoenix declared urgent act now stop the gun ban inside customers took time out from browsing through ak assault rifles and a flock of other firearms to sign a petition and to vent their wrath at a local turncoat u s sen dennis deconcini lrb d ariz rrb we are petitioning to protest the semiautomatic gun control bills before congress read the text above a fast growing list of names if we allow the government to become involved in any type of gun control we are violating a basic constitutional right the right to keep and bear arms the petitioners target that sunny day last spring was deconcini a longtime opponent of gun control measures who had suddenly switched sides sponsoring one of the nine bills currently in congress to ban the sale of assault weapons i m a one issue voter and i m going to do everything in my power to take deconcini out george hiers a burly man on crutches vowed as he bought a semiautomatic shotgun for his wife to defend herself with while he s away on hunting trips the attack on deconcini was stirred up by the national rifle assn in a display of fury that represented far more than retaliation against a former supporter long described as the powerful gun lobby the nra is now scrambling to recover from stunning setbacks in the past three years over the nra s opposition congress and state legislatures have enacted legislation banning cop killer bullets that penetrate protective vests plastic guns that can be slipped past metal detectors and saturday night specials that are used in many crimes and most recently the group found itself caught in the furor over assault weapons that was ignited by the massacre of five children in a stockton schoolyard last january those killings combined with the increasing use of the weapons by drug dealers and youth gangs have exacerbated the contentious relations between the nra and its former allies law enforcement leaders concerned about rising violence and terrorism have ended their friendliness toward the gun lobby and become well organized in opposition politicians once fearful of the nra have been much more willing to stand up to it president bush an nra life member on july imposed a permanent ban on imports of assault rifles and has proposed limiting the semiautomatics ammunition clips the ban so infuriated some nra members that they have launched petition drives in two dozen states to oust bush from the organization meanwhile california whose voters only seven years ago defeated an initiative that would have frozen the number of handguns in the state last may became the first state to ban assault weapons at the same time gun control organizations are beginning to match the nra s mass mailings ads and lobbying many schools are showing guns and the constitution an anti gun video produced by handgun control inc whose chairwoman is sarah brady wife of former white house press secretary james brady who was disabled by gunfire in the assassination attempt on then president reagan and the nra even is feeling pressure from more militant gun groups that threaten to drain away members and funds although enjoying a membership surge the nra ran up a record million deficit last year after spending more than million thus in fending off the assaults on assault weapons the year old nra is facing what its leaders call its most daunting challenge we re at a crossroads james jay baker the nra s top congressional lobbyist acknowledged as deconcini s assault weapons bill cleared its first senate hurdle in april we re going to go down the road of either prohibitive firearms regulations or tough criminal justice provisions that is more prosecutors penalties and prisons the course sought by the nra once you get into a lrb gun control rrb rut it s tough to get out of that rut aside from the nation s capital two of the hottest battlegrounds in the assault weapons fight are arizona and florida that would seem ironic since guns permeate the cultures of those generally conservative states but with opinion polls in both states showing that large majorities of residents support bans and with police complaining about being outgunned by criminals legislators have moved into action spurring angry counterattacks from the nra call now write today as pat jonas signed the petition in the gun store near phoenix one could witness the nra s true political power mobilizing citizens at the grass roots i do n t want to see guns outlawed jonas said because i like to collect guns probably no other organization in the world floods government officials with as many phone calls letters telegrams and visits from its members as the nra charles j orasin president of year old handgun control the nra s chief nemesis estimates that as many as members of the nra and other gun groups regularly lobby elected officials and bureaucrats the outpouring is prompted by red alert mailings churned out by nra leaders all sounding essentially the same alarm they re out to get your guns these letters go not only to the nra s million members whose annual membership fee brings such benefits as a magazine gun theft insurance and safety instruction but also to affiliated hunting organizations and shooting competition groups time and again the nra has proved that citizen action generated by such mailings can have far more effect on legislation than opinion polls especially when a majority for gun control is relatively silent if a lawmaker is looking for an excuse to vote with the nra all he has to say is i got a hundred calls from the nra but none from the other side said a congressional aide and in a close election a well organized single interest group such as the nra can wield decisive power by turning out highly motivated voters it was one of these red alert warnings written by nra lobbyist baker that had been delivered to gun owners in arizona and riled up the customers at the dealers outlet outside phoenix baker s letter assailed deconcini s bill a scaled down version of the one enacted by california in may deconcini s bill calls for a nationwide ban on sales of ak s and eight other semiautomatic rifles guns enjoying wide popularity because they have the menacing look and much of the firepower of fully automatic assault weapons used by the military and police lrb automatic guns fire bullets or so per trigger pull semiautomatics fire one bullet per trigger squeeze but a fast index finger can get off as many as shots in five seconds as ammunition is automatically reloaded from a clip and many semiautomatics can easily be converted to automatic weapons rrb in his letter baker called deconcini s proposal a tragic mistake charging that it could even block sales of traditional hunting rifles and lead to criminal charges against million sportsmen who own semiautomatic guns does anyone seriously believe lrb senate bill rrb will stop drug smugglers who bring cocaine by the planeload from bringing in any guns they want and selling them on the profitable black market senator deconcini s bill will create baker s letter asked it concluded with a call to arms warning that deconcini needs to know we will not allow our constitutional freedoms to be strangled by restrictions that have absolutely no effect on the criminals who are supposed to be the real target call now write today lies and exaggerations gun owners rage spread quickly after the nra letter hit arizona the last week of april in three weeks deconcini s office received calls and letters against his bill and for it despite a poll indicating that more than two thirds of the people in metropolitan phoenix favor some kind of ban on assault weapons i ve been to the four corners of arizona and people are shocked and dismayed by deconcini s bill said landis aden a motorcycle riding computer technician who lobbies part time for the arizona nra aden believes that semiautomatic guns would come in handy if a mexican revolution spilled over the border and arizonans got caught in the cross fire you could defend your farm or your ranch fairly well he said martin mandall a brash scottsdale gun dealer who insisted that a reporter feel the thrill of firing uzi and ak machine guns at a range in his store basement vowed during a conversation there to work with the utmost severity to get deconcini out of office he said he had sold three years stock of assault rifles in the two weeks after bush issued a temporary import ban in march people are talking recall here said lee echols range master for the phoenix rod and gun club we stood behind deconcini at the last election and we feel he has completely betrayed us another member of the club bill houston telephoned deconcini aide matthew mccoy in his washington office to protest mccoy s end of the conversation went this way you re misinterpreting the legislation recall election i think that will hurt everybody and not help anybody you think that by attempting to burn your friends you can if the alternative were something more strict than deconcini s legislation how would you feel then metzenbaum is going to come from somewhere out of left field sen howard m metzenbaum lrb d ohio rrb is pushing a ban that is much broader than deconcini s interviewed in his phoenix office as the firestorm was building a serene deconcini accused the nra of lies and exaggerations about his bill he strongly disputed the nra s claim that a provision banning any gun nearly identical to the nine listed in the measure could be interpreted to cover virtually all semiautomatics the recently re elected senator said he was trying to head off more drastic legislation from metzenbaum and others including california democratic reps howard l berman of panorama city and fortney h lrb pete rrb stark of oakland but deconcini was also careful to take political cover behind two republicans who are nra life members he noted bush s import ban and cited a salty declaration by barry m goldwater arizona s venerable former senator that semiautomatic guns have no place in anybody s arsenal if any s o b ca n t hit a deer with one shot then he ought to quit shooting lrb goldwater made the remark shortly after appearing in a full page i m the nra ad in time magazine rrb deconcini an nra person of the month last year said that nra officials flat told me we ca n t negotiate on his bill because they were burned so badly last year when they negotiated with lrb then atty gen edwin rrb meese on banning plastic guns they said their membership and revenues fell off now they need to get members and money and that s why they re doing this to me if i were n t a mature person i d say up yours now i m going to be a gun control advocate and you re going to lose me later he said at a senate hearing on his bill by using these tactics the nra is succeeding only in alienating its friend closest to the fight foxes in the henhouse as the nra waged its war in the west marion p hammer a year old grandmother with brown bangs strode to the front of another heated battleground in tallahassee fla a packed meeting room in the state s house of representatives a subcommittee was getting ready to vote on a bill that would ban a list of semiautomatic assault weapons and hammer had asked to speak against it only feet inches tall she could barely be seen as she took the podium her gray slacks blue ruffled blouse and blue suede jacket complemented her steel blue eyes but belied her credentials prize winning marksman and hardball lobbyist for the florida nra to her supporters hammer represents all that is strong about the nra to her detractors much that is weak attacking the crux of the bill hammer told the subcommittee you can not differentiate between semiautomatic firearms that look menacing and your routine sporting firearms because functionally they are the same next she dealt acidly with one of the nra s prickliest political problems there are some law enforcement officers who are nra members who are against us i would suggest to you that it would not be the first time that the fox has been in the henhouse finally as nra washington lobbyist baker had done in his letter to arizona gun owners hammer charged that a loosely worded definition in the florida bill would inadvertently ban all semiautomatic rifles and shotguns that is the ban would cover not just the targeted guns the ones with folding stocks that make them easy to conceal pistol grips huge ammunition clips and flash suppressors that according to police make it easy to spray bullets from the hip but doomed as well she claimed would be firearms of traditional design long used by hunters and target shooters in one of the nation s gun owningest states taking away firearms from law abiding citizens who have lawfully owned them for decades is not the solution to violent crime she declared one might have expected the house subcommittee to reject the bill handily on that april day after all two years earlier hammer had led a phenomenal victory for the nra in florida winning passage of measures that threw out all locally imposed gun restrictions the action was so sweeping that many sunshine staters thought that they had been freed to carry guns openly wild west style the legislature later closed that seeming loophole in the wake of widespread hoots about the gunshine state but it left intact all other provisions including one making it much easier in many areas to obtain a concealed weapon permit hammer has skillfully built support for the changes in the gun laws over many years rising at a m after less than four hours sleep chain smoking filter tip cigarettes sipping diet sodas and aided only by one part time staffer and a yearly budget she tirelessly works capitol corridors and grinds out newsletters aimed at firing up the nra s florida members to contact their representatives once she threw a party at a firing range for legislators aides spouses and children hundreds feasted on shrimp and oysters and many took shooting lessons from expert instructors testimonials to hammer s lobbying efforts not to mention her marksmanship with muzzle loading rifles cover the walls of her office among the plaques and pictures is a winchester carbine from the national antique arms assn recognizing her as the first woman to receive its roy rogers man of the year award despite her past successes however the house panel voted to pass the assault weapons bill along to the full criminal justice committee hammer still would have several opportunities to halt the bill s progress but the surprising setback symbolized the nra s shifting fortunes not only in florida but across the nation the nra has been unreasonable with their positions for so long it s catching up with them now asserted rep ronald a silver a miami beach democrat who chairs the criminal justice panel one of the nra s major problems he said is that a number of legislative allies have been angered by its strong arm tactics when the group decided they went astray dramatic evidence of this cropped up the day before the house action when sen john a grant jr a conservative tampa republican who heads a companion senate committee was being interviewed about prospects for an assault weapons ban as hammer sat casually on a table nearby waiting to request that an nra videotape be shown to the panel grant remarked that the gun lobby is very well organized and i give them credit for being able to rally the troops on very short notice but asked if the nra provides accurate information he responded with a backward glance at hammer well sometimes they get a little bit overzealous when they said i was part of the gestapo last year that was a little out of order hammer explained later that grant was referring to a newsletter in which she had said that a bill in his committee sets up a modern day gestapo movement because it threatened to invalidate many concealed weapon permits i was n t calling members of that committee gestapo she maintained nevertheless grant was so enraged that he had an aide call nra officials in washington to demand her removal state sen george g kirkpatrick jr lrb d gainesville rrb protested in an interview that he had been savagely attacked by hammer s group in his latest campaign despite a strong pro gun voting record they wrote the most vicious letters he said they called me judas because he had backed a senate leadership team viewed by the nra as sympathetic to controls on handguns and assault weapons kirkpatrick who easily won re election predicted that such tactics will backfire because of the nra s unwillingness to sit down and work out a reasonable solution to problems perceived by the public it makes it much more difficult to get their mission accomplished he said said hammer he s very bitter but i have a job to do we have a right to vigorously oppose anyone whose actions are detrimental to our best interests hammer faces another growing problem competition from lobbyists on the other side for instance the day of the house subcommittee vote on assault weapons she was outmaneuvered by bernard horn the state legislative director for handgun control who had flown in from washington horn gave legislators a booklet picturing both the guns proposed for banning and other semiautomatic rifles that were not on the list but that are popular with hunters the move was aimed at shattering the nra s claim that only cosmetic differences exist between assault weapons and sporting guns the effect on subcommittee member carol hanson lrb r boca raton rrb was decisive because of the booklet she said she was no longer willing to support merely a limit on the capacity of ammunition clips a fallback position to which hammer had reluctantly acceded now hanson said she favored banning the guns themselves eventually hammer was able to minimize her losses instead of banning assault weapons the legislature in june created a commission to study them and instead of enacting a seven day waiting period for gun buyers as sought by handgun control it required dealers to make a less comprehensive background check by telephoning a police computer voters will decide next year whether to accept a three day waiting period although a handgun control news release declared florida deals nra fourth loss of year hammer was able to say with some justification i think we did pretty good the tide turned her way she claimed after legislators saw how student demonstrators in china were overwhelmed by troops because they were unarmed shortly after adjourning the legislature was called back into special session to reconsider a bill that would make it illegal for gun owners to carelessly leave weapons around children the nra had helped kill the measure weeks earlier but after a spate of gun accidents killed three children and wounded three others in early june hammer gave conditional support to the bill and it passed overwhelmingly rambo sells on a breezy day last spring a riot of orange and gold striped tulips swayed outside the gunmetal gray nra headquarters in washington inside the eight story building many of the employees worked on gun safety courses shooting competitions police firearms training and other services that predominated at the nra until heavy lobbying against gun control began in the s the shift came after the murders of two kennedys and a king inspired passage of major federal gun regulations in in his seventh floor office jim baker one of five in house lobbyists supplemented by four high powered outsiders had put the finishing touches on his letter to arizona gun owners slamming deconcini s bill i want this carefully fly specked for mistakes he told a secretary as he left for lunch over a roast beef sandwich and beer at a plush hotel restaurant the handsome year old former prosecutor was asked whether barry goldwater s assertion that hunters do n t need assault weapons had undermined the nra s effort to prevent the ban you do n t need any particular gun you do n t need to hunt but i do n t think you should have to justify anything in terms of need that s a socialist concept you ought to be able to own within reasonable limits what you want the question is whether these proposals will fight crime effectively and we think highly restrictive gun controls are a bankrupt concept baker argued that claims of assault weapon violence are grossly exaggerated and that the stockton massacre could have been carried out with almost any gun not just the semiautomatic ak wielded by patrick purdy a bit more candidly j warren cassidy the nra s executive vice president later acknowledged that the goldwater comment had hurt badly cassidy said a number of concerned nra members wrote him asking what are you going to do about this he wrote back asking what do you want me to do i ca n t recall him he s out of office he s an american legend but cassidy noted in the interview when a guy like barry or dennis deconcini does these things it s a belt to the solar plexus because you ve counted on these fellows tom korologos one of the nra s well connected outside lobbyists recalled another example of the difficulty of fighting off assault weapon bans he said that while touring exhibition booths at the nra s recent national convention he came across a basic rifle that had a big banana clip and a big round thing to hold it with it looked for all the world like rambo s personal gun korologos asked the exhibitor why are you ruining this perfectly legitimate rifle ah came the response but they sell korologos commented never mind it does n t do us any good on capitol hill to have those damn things loose an nra operative conceded that despite a tough no compromise resolution unanimously adopted at the national convention the nra might have to back a compromise bill when congress takes final action on assault weapons we may be branded as traitors but that s the nature of the game in this town to forge agreements and compromises said the source who requested anonymity actually in the face of increasingly well organized support for gun control the nra grudgingly compromised on cop killer bullets in and plastic guns in to fight assault weapon bills baker said the nra hopes to spend million most of it derived from direct mail appeals the organization s revenues last year included million from membership dues and million from contributions about one fourth of the million in expenditures was spent on lobbying in addition the nra is continuing to contribute heavily to political campaigns despite the disappointments it suffered in last year s elections in five incumbents and all challengers supported by the nra were defeated although incumbents won the nra netted no gain with the it poured into campaigns for the assault weapons fight the nra has sent dozens of police officers to washington to offset pro ban lobbying by police chiefs launched a national newspaper and tv ad campaign and continued to make available to gun owners a toll phone number that has already produced thousands of nra form letters to president bush and members of congress baker denied that nra officials had anything to do with the petition drive to purge bush from membership saying that it originated with rank and filers obviously disappointed with the president s first six months in office but he added that the nra board of directors would be forced to consider the matter at its september meeting for a while the nra harshly retaliated against police chiefs who spoke out for gun control seeking to get chiefs fired in nashville tenn and baltimore county md but dover n h chief charles reynolds president of the international assn of chiefs of police said that he and nra president joe foss recently agreed to keep the debate issue oriented without personal attacks the most frequent charge against the nra is the one leveled by deconcini that it lies and exaggerates denying this baker said a survey of congress by the american library assn had found that the library group and the nra supplied the most accurate information of all lobbying organizations in truth the compliment appeared in a library journal gossip column citing only the opinion of a highly placed library source in washington d c graceanne decandido who wrote the item said it was based on dinner table conversation with a government bureaucrat to have the nra use that in support of their policies is beyond ludicrous she said a prayer for arms at the nra s national convention in april more than people roamed across square feet of exhibits at st louis convention center they shouldered pea green sig assault rifles they clicked the triggers of super light glock pistols they marveled at new laser targeting devices that can project a red beam hundreds of feet from gun to bull s eye and then during a break nra activists filed into a cavernous hall where merrill l lrb pete rrb petoskey a wildlife biologist from lewiston mich delivered the opening prayer at the nra s th annual meeting dear god creator of all please give us the direction to make lrb gun control advocates rrb understand that the actions of criminals who should be confined should not be dramatized into legislation that will impose on the rights of millions of law abiding citizens to own and bear arms for lawful pursuits of recreation and self defense please help and guide the leaders of the national rifle association and of this nation to preserve and strengthen this freedom and this right amen addressing the meeting nra president foss acknowledged that the beleaguered group could indeed use more help he called on the nation s million gun owners to get off their duffs if they want to keep their guns the news media the grizzled hero of two wars said have a million reasons for us not to have guns but look at what happened in germany when ol hitler did a good job in disarming the nation if people are armed it keeps the bad actors off the scene with your help chimed in wayne r lapierre jr head of the nra s lobbying we will protect your basic god given right to defend yourself and to own firearms in this country at the nra s annual banquet that night actor charlton heston evoked his famous movie image of moses on the mountaintop as he provided the group with an inspirational boost as the main speaker heston noted that he keeps beside his bed a caliber service revolver that he brought back from world war ii that s a semiautomatic weapon and i do not plan to surrender it he proclaimed banging the lectern then accepting an ornate flintlock rifle from the nra for his years of support heston hoisted it above his head as if it were a stone tablet intoning the punch line of a defiant pro gun slogan he suggested that nobody was going to take this weapon from him unless it was pried from my cold dead hands the diners leaped up roaring for an army of crusaders besieged it was just the rousing send off needed for the tough battles ahead
