world bank president barber conable was so well regarded during his year career as a republican congressman from new york that some journalists nicknamed him h r for highly respected and to many on capitol hill mr conable still is rep tom foley a liberal democrat from washington state calls him a very strong asset to the nation institution because of the enormous respect he has on both sides of the aisle but at the world bank mr conable finds himself under fire after a year and a half in office he has failed to move the bank into a leadership role on the third world debt problem the world bank has been reluctant to step out on this issue in confrontation and conflict with the treasury charges sen bill bradley a new jersey democrat and congress s leading voice on the debt problem rep john lafalce a new york democrat and another leader on the issue agrees there surely is a much larger role for the world bank in the debt problem than it has played so far but they just ca n t get out ahead of the administration he says while the debt morass has deepened mr conable s world bank has looked inward shuffling its organization charts around in a disruptive reorganization and then campaigning for a billion increase in its capital as congress considers the increase liberal critics on capitol hill are demanding that mr conable show he is ready to use the bank s vast resources to make some direct impact on reducing the huge burden of third world debt house democrats in fact cut out of the foreign aid bill passed last month all million the administration had sought for the first year of the u s share of the increase in capital the deletion was made pending action by a committee looking into the bank s approach to the debt crisis so far mr conable has approached the debt crisis more like a cautious financier than a bold politician he has clung to the bank s traditional role of a conventional lender and adviser to developing nations and has deferred on ideas about the debt to the man who picked him for his job u s treasury secretary james baker mr conable subscribes to the baker plan which stresses new lending by commercial banks and the world bank to debtor countries that adopt growth oriented market based economic reforms the bank has tried to help the countries by tiding them over with some new loans that policy contrasts sharply with some of the more aggressive debt reduction plans sen bradley worried that the debt burden stalls growth and threatens political stability in developing countries proposes that third world debtors be required to make certain economic reforms in return their lending banks would forgive some of the loans and write them down on their books even the world bank s longtime financial wizard eugene rotberg who quit the bank for merrill lynch over mr conable s reorganization plan proposed last month that the world bank guarantee new year commercial bank loans to third world countries other experts advocate a debt facility to buy and refinance the debts defending his approach to the debt problem mr conable explains we are n t a financial institution but a development institution we ca n t go to our member countries and say give us a tremendous capital increase so we can assume the obligations of all these other creditors that a developing country owes obviously that would be viewed as our not performing a development function but our simply accepting other people s risks but critics reject that view jeffrey sachs a harvard economist who has offered one of many debt reduction plans says the world bank s officials have the great potential to play a central role in the problem but they re basically ducking there is a lack of intellectual leadership within the bank itself even some reagan administration officials privately despair of mr conable s leadership and fear that it may have been a mistake to appoint him while financial experts often urge the bank to do more the ponderous institution has intervened only about half a dozen times in debt crises usually just to guarantee a small portion of a commercial bank loan package mr conable makes it clear that it wo n t do that often recently commercial bank lenders to brazil tried to get the world bank to insure a portion of a big new loan package they were negotiating but the u s treasury was firmly opposed to the idea saying it was unnecessary in brazil s case and might foster the impression that such guarantees should be common secretary baker says mr conable is being criticized largely by legislators and academicians who favor grand debt relief schemes that would take the debt and put it on the backs of the taxpayers i ll tell you who ll pay for it you and me when we file our s it s a bad idea they want barber to subscribe to it and i think that he sees that it s a bad idea yet even inside the bank there is increasing worry that the third world debt totaling trillion last year frustrates the bank s goals because of chronic debt problems the development process in these countries has stalled the world bank said earlier this year also within the bank s own ranks there is talk that could lead to a more aggressive role on debt once president reagan leaves office baker s approach has to be adapted to the circumstances of today says the bank s no man operations vice president moeen qureshi perhaps we have excessively underplayed our own role he adds it seems to me it will be desirable in the present environment to see what can be done to reduce debt rather than just lend new money partly in response to the external and internal pressures mr conable sent a debt study to his board early in april the likelihood is that the bank will need to play a more extensive and diversified role in two areas new money packages and facilitating other forms of financial relief including debt reduction schemes declares the study which was drafted by david bock a vice president and the bank s debt expert the document even says that for a few debtors consensual debt relief including outright forgiveness might be the only workable solution but it stresses that the bank must avoid moves that threaten the preservation of the bank s prime standing in financial markets the bank s own annual world debt report illustrates its determination to stick to a back seat role on the issue published early this year the report noted that the debtor countries position has stubbornly failed to improve said imagination and resolve are needed and emphasized that leadership will itself be crucially important but conspicuously absent from the report which discussed debt relief proposals from secretary baker sen bradley and others were any ideas from the bank itself the world bank s ethos is decidedly traditional founded in it has evolved into a well paid bureaucracy of working in buildings a few blocks from the white house ignored by tourists but a mandatory stop for finance ministers and bankers visiting washington the bank earns more than billion annually sports a top credit rating in securities markets and lent nearly billion last year the u s is its biggest shareholder and controls the president s job the idea of the bank was to finance a wide range of economically basic construction across the developing world roads in africa power projects in asia schools in latin america irrigation in india under robert mcnamara the bank began aiding efforts to alleviate rural poverty control population growth and fight illiteracy under a w clausen his successor it increased its loans to finance structural adjustments rather than specific development projects in third world economies and also disbursed money more quickly under mr conable a low key thoughtful man with a self deprecating sense of humor new policies have been harder to discern he has continued to increase the quick disbursing non project loans but has n t introduced any new type of lending he also has set a goal for alleviating poverty in asia and has won new financing to help the poor countries of africa but his main achievements have been bureaucratic he set up staffs to handle environmental and women s issues one of these is the safe motherhood initiative a project designed to lower the high rate of deaths during childbirth especially in africa funds will be increased for related health and nutrition programs mr conable spent roughly a year reorganizing the bank so that project experts and country experts would work more closely the new organization is more in tune with current third world problems but the change paralyzed the bank for months and delayed loan processing mr conable contends that the reorganization has helped a great deal in recapturing the support of our member countries which had refused to approve the bank s budget just before he took office we have had a pretty good year he says we had a support of our budget and we are well on the way toward a substantial general capital increase and he adds i have changed a lot of emphasis in our programs traditionally conservatives have criticized the bank charging that its policies promote central planning and thus discourages market forces but the debt crisis is causing liberals to question mr conable s leadership from a different direction who is calling the shots on debt policy in the administration the treasury and who was responsible for appointing conable the treasury sen bradley contends they appointed somebody that they knew they could control maybe conable genuinely agrees with baker in which case he should be lumped in with baker for criticism if he disagrees maybe we ll see some new ideas at the world bank mr conable insists that even though he backs the baker debt strategy he and the treasury secretary have had strategic disagreements bank staffers cite a loan to chile last year over u s opposition the bank has accelerated lending to the most heavily indebted countries but the new money is being swamped by interest payments and commercial banks are putting up little new money of their own in the nations paid back lenders billion more than they got in new loans also that year the world bank took back in repayments million more than it pumped into the three largest latin debtors brazil mexico and argentina last year that was reversed the three countries received a million inflow however that again was more than offset by commercial bank outflows rep joseph kennedy iii a massachusetts democrat charges that the world bank is just laundering funds that go back to the banks like secretary baker mr conable instinctively dismisses sweeping debt relief plans as coercive or non market oriented he rejects any notion that the bank might get involved in directly refinancing or providing security for debt on a broad scale we are not there to try and handle their short term debt problems and if you think we are then i think you misunderstand the nature of this institution he says but mr conable s own nature still is n t clear rep lafalce argues barber conable is an outstanding person he says he had a strong identity here in congress which he earned but he does n t have his own identity as president of the world bank he was created by jim baker and george bush in this job his reputation now rests on how he defines himself
