several thousand tanks and other armored vehicles not to mention the government s air forces politically the two republics declarations of independence have been ignored by the rest of the world which supports a united yugoslavia so far no foreign countries have recognized slovenian and croatian independence on the contrary the european community and the u s have lobbied heavily for the maintainance of the yugoslav state and have threatened to withhold millions of dollars in aid if the country breaks up but u s secretary of state james baker appealed to belgrade to find a way for croatia and slovenia to express their national aspirations through negotiations and dialogue rather than bloodshed mr baker and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater had suggested to reporters

control from belgrade the capital of both serbia and yugoslavia the nationalist governments of slovenia and croatia have been demanding a looser confederation of sovereign republics serbian attempts

croatian government and they fear losing the economic support of slovenia and croatia the two wealthiest republics on the other hand slovenia and croatia say they could no longer tolerate the erosion of their finances by the serbian dominated bureaucracy together slovenia with two million people and croatia with five million supply nearly two thirds of yugoslavia s foreign exchange and about half of the country s gross national product they are also yugoslavia s gateway to western europe
