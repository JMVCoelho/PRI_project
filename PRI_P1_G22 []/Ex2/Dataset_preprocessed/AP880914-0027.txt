with the winds of hurricane gilbert clocked at miles per hour u s weather officials called gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere mark zimmer a meterologist at the national hurricane center reported an air force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at gilbert s center at inches at p m edt on tuesday gilbert was barreling toward mexico s yucatan peninsula that s the lowest pressure ever measured in the western hemisphere zimmer said the previous record low pressure of inches was set by the labor day hurricane that struck the florida keys with winds above mph killing people he said with tropical storm force winds extending miles north and miles south of the hurricane s center gilbert also was one of the largest but because the circumference of a hurricane changes so often during its course no records are kept on their overall size said center meterologist jesse moore hurricane debby which barely crossed the mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking mexico last month was probably about half that size moore said gilbert is one of only three category storms in the hemisphere since weather officials began keeping detailed records the others were the labor day hurricane and hurricane camille which bulldozed the mississippi coast with mph winds and a foot wave in leaving billion in damage and dead a hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster in u s history however that storm hit galveston texas sept and killed more than people category storms have winds greater than mph barometric pressure of less than inches and a storm surge higher than feet the storm surge _ a great dome of water that follows the eye of the hurricane across coastlines bulldozing everything in its path _ accounts for nine out of hurricane fatalities camille s storm surge was feet high but the hurricane center was forecasting a surge of only feet for gilbert zimmer said the damage from these worst case hurricanes is catastrophic _ shrubs and trees blown down all street signs gone roofs and windows blown away and shattered and mobile homes destroyed moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane zimmer said the engine itself is this tall chimney of warm moist air in the center if the atmospheric conditions in general allow this warm chimney to build to very high levels miles high then you can have a severe hurricane category storms cause extreme damage with winds from to mph surge of feet and pressure of to the weakest hurricanes category cause minimal damage with winds of to mph foot surge and pressure at or more
