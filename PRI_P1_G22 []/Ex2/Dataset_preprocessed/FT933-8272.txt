the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease which has killed more than animals in the uk is causing a new wave of public concern new cases are still running at almost a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of creutzfeld jacob disease a brain disorder similar to bse richard lacey a microbiology professor at leeds university and the leading critic of government policy on bse said the deaths this year of two farmers whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to chance he believes that bse can trigger human brain disease our worst predictions are coming true he said i find it unbelievable that the government and their hand picked advisers can go on telling the public there is no danger the advisers led by the government s chief medical officer kenneth calman and chief veterinary officer keith meldrum put out a detailed statement to justify their view that last month s death of year old duncan templeman following that of peter warhurst a year ago showed no features that give cause for undue concern the official view is that the deaths are an unfortunate coincidence even though it is statistically unlikely that two dairy farmers should contract a disease as rare as cjd robert will of edinburgh s western general hospital who has been monitoring cjd in the uk since on behalf of the health department calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of even a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with bse affected herds one argument put forward by the health department is that cjd has such a long incubation period typically to years that clinical symptoms would not yet have appeared even if bse had triggered any cases of cjd since the illness of the cows lrb in templeman s herd rrb and the patient occurred within months of each other the animals and the patient had presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years the health department said it is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between the cases of bse and the occurrence of disease in the patient another reassuring argument is that both farmers showed clinical features typical of the sporadic form of cjd of unknown cause that usually occurs in late middle age the handful of patients known to have developed cjd through infection lrb from contaminated human growth hormone rrb showed a different pattern of symptoms the second annual report of will s national cjd surveillance unit in edinburgh published last month shows what looks at first sight like a disturbing rise in incidence from uk cases in the year ended april to in and in but the report says that this is not statistically significant and is probably due to increasing awareness of cjd lrb some cases were previously attributed to alzheimer s or other forms of dementia rrb meanwhile cattle are succumbing to bse at a rate of about one per every year the epidemic continues to defy the ministry of agriculture s predictions that it is about to wane so far this year there have been reported cases compared with to the same date last year the source of infection was protein rich cattle feed contaminated with scrapie a related brain disease of sheep although sheep derived feeds were banned from sale in farmers apparently continued to use existing stocks for longer than the ministry had expected the incubation period is also longer than originally expected veterinary experts say that almost all of the confirmed bse cases so far can be attributed to scrapie contaminated feed according to their investigations maternal transmission from cow to calf which would prolong the epidemic is very rare or non existent scientists trying to understand the epidemic face an unusual problem bse scrapie and cjd are caused by a bizarre infectious agent the prion which does not follow the normal rules of microbiology recent research shows that the prion is an abnormal form of a protein that is normally present in the brain lrb though its normal function is not yet known rrb unlike viruses and bacteria prions contain no genetic material of their own the prion may arise by a genetic mutation lrb spontaneous or inherited rrb in the host animal or in the case of bse it may arrive from another animal once in place in the victim s brain it catalyses what john collinge a prion researcher at st mary s hospital medical school london called a slow chemical chain reaction converting the normal protein into its own abnormal form the prion molecule is folded in a way that makes it extremely stable and therefore difficult to destroy by conventional sterilisation experiments show that bse can be transmitted between species for example from cow to monkey by injecting or eating large amounts of infected tissue but transmission is dose dependent collinge says most independent experts maintain that no human being dairy farmer or beef eater is likely to be exposed to bse in sufficient quantities to develop brain disease
