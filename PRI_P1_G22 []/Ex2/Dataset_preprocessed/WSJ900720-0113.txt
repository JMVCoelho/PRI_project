as alberto fujimori prepares to take over as peru s next president on july the question of whether the shining path will hound his administration as it has the previous two ranks high among his concerns among shining path watchers lrb senderlogos rrb there is strong disagreement on fundamentals is the shining path getting stronger or weaker is it making progress or losing ground among the population and finally who is actually winning the war there are no easy answers there is not much of a dispute on the basic data however the shining path went to war in on the same day peru was holding general elections after years of a military dictatorship its first actions were cautious modest and often ludicrous in a crazy way lrb like hanging dogs from lampposts with scribbled insults over them to chinese communist martyrs rrb but the actions intensified and soon became quite lethal while president fernando belaunde s regime did what it could to maintain democratic legality at first it was quite unprepared to deal with any insurgency especially with one that had been meticulously planned and organized several years before the first shot was fired in october emergency laws were imposed for the first time on part of peru they covered only of the population now about of all peruvians live under emergency law in years the war between the shining path and the government has cost about lives damages are estimated at billion or about of peru s annual gross national product if the armed forces have been rightly accused of systematic violations of human rights lrb peru ranks as one of the world s worst human rights offenders rrb the military faults the civilian authorities for failing to provide much needed leadership mr belaunde lrb the first to deal with the problem rrb who tried to ignore the insurgency out of existence is regarded as a well meaning but inept leader there are no kind words for mr garcia on the other hand in the first weeks of his mandate he made several right moves like emphasizing his role as commander in chief of the armed forces and reorganizing the corruption ridden police but things began to unravel soon after at first he tried a liberal approach looking for a dialogue with the fanatical shining path and sending scores of young professionals to the emergency areas to attack what he said were the root causes of the insurgency but dialogue was disdainfully rejected dozens of these professionals were assassinated and the armed forces slowed down their actions while the rebels made largely unimpeded progress then mr garcia tried a tougher approach and human rights violations surged to their current level and for the first time death squads linked by some analysts to mr garcia s apra party began to contribute to the killing midpoint during his term mr garcia lost all hope of defeating the shining path and decided just to coexist with it says rafael merino a respected analyst on security matters not even in that was mr garcia successful as violence climbed steadily during the second half of his term in people were killed as a result of insurgent or counterinsurgent actions in were killed and during the first six months of how well is mr fujimori expected to deal with the insurgency his campaign pitch advocated an approach closely resembling that of mr garcia s first year according to francisco loayza mr fujimori s adviser on internal security matters military actions against the shining path should be subordinated to economic development initiatives lcb the military rcb should mainly provide security for development projects mr loayza says he stressed that the main thrust of mr fujimori s pacification policies would be to address the structural violence lcb read social injustice rcb that makes subversion possible mr loayza says that president garcia s approach failed because of corruption and ineptitude he also feels that the shining path is weakened and that an important shining path faction would be willing to engage in peace talks this is only wishful thinking according to mr merino if president fujimori thinks he ll finish the war through those pacification policies it will be like riding into battle with no better dress or weapons than a tuxedo actually mr fujimori might end up implementing internal war policies that would be quite different from those advocated during his campaign at least that s what seems is going to happen with the economy where the vote getting populist message appears in the process of being replaced by a far more orthodox approach free market economist hernando de soto who has been advising mr fujimori during the past month thinks that might be the case he learns fast mr de soto told me recently and he has all the right instincts even if mr fujimori proves to be a quick learner he will have his work cut out for him running against all major trends of contemporary history the insurgents have followed shining path founder abimael guzman with the commitment that the faithful reserve for their prophet this was evident when walking through their safe house in lima it looked said a peruvian journalist like the seed for the future museum of the revolution wood carvings woven baskets tapestries paintings chiseled stone all meticulously lovingly crafted with the mythified motifs of the internal war there were also the hagiographic representations of mr guzman himself in the various postures that endeavored to combine the heroic with the intellectual a whole closed inbred culture developed in the underground and unnoticed by most peruvians except when it explodes in their faces mr gorriti is a peruvian author and journalist
