but even as memphians whoop it up the prediction that the big one may come in december is triggering tremors up and down the mississippi valley shaken thousands of people are crowding into earthquake survival classes in arnold mo people showed up for one course in missouri and arkansas some schools and businesses have announced plans to close in early december entrepreneurs are hawking quake insurance survival kits and gas line safety gadgets some people are planning to flee you ca n t run from everything says tammy mccormick a nurse in blytheville ark who will take her two youngsters and spend several days with relatives in north carolina but it seems stupid to stay on a fault line with a prediction like this everybody talks about the san andreas fault in california but the midwest actually has had three of the most powerful earthquakes on this continent in and along a mile zig zag formation called the new madrid fault a series of quakes ravaged the midwest researchers estimate those earthquakes ranked stronger than on the richter scale which had n t been invented yet they were more than times greater than the quake that rocked california s bay area last october church bells rang as far away as boston chimneys crumbled in cincinnati and as tons of soil and rock bed pitched and rolled in a seismic frenzy new waterfalls spiked up causing part of the mighty mississippi river to flow backward for several hours the new madrid lrb pronounced mad rid rrb fault still has small mostly unfelt earthquakes a year in the next years experts warn the area has a chance of a quake measuring that could produce billions of dollars in damage and thousands of casualties we re overdue for one in the s and low s says david stewart an earthquake expert at southeast missouri state university over the years a few pinpoint on the map towns have tried to capitalize on the little known fault new madrid mo the fault s namesake draws tourists to a museum with exhibits on the th century devastation and paragould ark has held earthquake festivals with events like the miss faultless beauty contest but as monday dec approaches the whole matter is becoming more serious that s because the predictor has gained credibility in some important circles for his work on the climate iben browning a year old scientist predicted october s bay area quake a week before it happened say people who heard him speak to the equipment manufacturers institute and he predicted geological danger on sept along a band of latitude that included mexico city where a massive quake struck on that day mr browning who has a ph d in physiology genetics and bacteriology writes a climate newsletter out of new mexico he has clients such as painewebber inc who have long paid for his wisdom on how the weather will affect their agricultural investments since mr browning says he has picked the correct dates of four large earthquakes two volcanoes and one day with both a volcano and an earthquake he bases his forecasts on tidal forces caused by the positions of the sun and the moon an old theory critics say that does n t wash on dec those forces are expected to be at a year high mr browning says that will exert pressure that could trigger faults already ripe to fail the new madrid area has a chance of producing at least a quake on dec give or take a day or two on either side mr browning says at that time a similar quake has a lesser chance of occurring on california s san andreas or hayward faults according to mr browning and an quake in tokyo has a greater chance skepticism abounds no responsible scientist can predict an exact day for an earthquake says brian mitchell a quake expert at st louis university echoing the majority opinion but mr browning should n t be written off so quickly says southeast missouri state s mr stewart who recently spent four days with mr browning he has a methodology that can determine plus or minus a window of a day or two an enhanced probability of a volcano or an earthquake in certain latitudes says mr stewart no one else has been able to replicate it but that does n t mean it s wrong mr browning says it s not easy being on record with predictions that few other scientists will support i feel like a lonely little petunia in a cabbage patch he says but asked if he enjoys being right he says it s the only damn thing that matters if one is a business consultant they do n t pay you for being wrong plenty of other business people are cashing in on his prediction insurance salespeople are peddling earthquake coverage to homeowners and businesses salespeople from a memphis company pop up at survival seminars with a device lrb for and up rrb that turns off gas lines when a quake hits and entrepreneurs are marketing two kinds of earthquake t shirts in memphis one says i m staying the other i m leaving all of this has changed life in places like blytheville ark lrb pop rrb tucked amid vast flat farmland right at the corner of the arkansas tennessee and missouri borders so many people plan to skip town on dec that the flexible technologies tubing plant already plans to shut down for two days at a cost of thousands of dollars says jimmy connell plant superintendent it s going to be a ghost town around here robert edwards a blytheville fireman who teaches seminars in earthquake survival has become a hot property for five years most of his classes were lightly attended now his phone answering machine says he is almost completely booked through october for one recent class he was in osceola ark it is a m on a rainy saturday and osceolans gripping legal pads and spiral notebooks fill the high school auditorium for an all day session on earthquake preparedness with his booming voice mr edwards lays out a grim scenario one hundred and fifty thousand dead in memphis instantly instantly and all the federal emergency help is going to go there and st louis you have to be prepared to take complete care of yourself for hours to two weeks you may be five to six months without power after the seminar two elderly sisters both widows split on what to do fearing their home will be looted bess mann years old wants to ride it out but her sister hallie peterson wants to stay with their nephew in mississippi scared that the big memphis arkansas bridge that spans the mississippi river will collapse in a quake she s charting an alternate route two hours out of her way school districts in earle and wilson ark have announced closings around dec some schools practice earthquake drills while others sponsor cake sales to buy survival kits for classrooms with items like blankets flashlights and radios michael prince a child psychologist in jonesboro says he knows of to children age four to nine so unnerved that they ve reverted to bed wetting or extreme anxiety about being separated from their parents trying to calm the fear the national earthquake prediction evaluation council a panel of academic and government seismic experts will review the browning claim at a meeting in a few weeks in years of studying prediction methods the panel has found no bona fide approach the group usually ignores claims that are n t scientifically documented lrb like the one by the california man who said his goldfish helped him predict quakes rrb but this one says randall updike the executive secretary has created such chaos in the mid continent region that we felt we had to give our advice mr browning says he is tentatively booked to give a talk in minneapolis on dec and he does n t plan to go there via st louis but he adds i highly recommend against panic that will kill more people than earthquakes
