to run:

python exercise-1.py

original.txt is the document from which we will extract the keyphrases.

Running will create some files/folders:

- Dataset: folder with all the 20newsgroup documents, preprocessed. (this one will probably be sent, not created in run time for time's sake).

- Keyphrases.txt: the extracted keyphrases;

- Preprocessed.txt: the preprocessed version of the original document.



#lines 167 and 168 of the code will be commented so that the whole dataset and the file arent preprocessed in run time, they'll be provided.

Note: this was tested and coded in a Windows machine. Unix may have errors with Paths. If that happens, please change "/" in the global variables to "\"
