comment thermal recalibration generalnew drives perform order increase overall integrity data writesbasically firmware instructs actuator perform test see data tracks within certain physical tolerance since media heats cools track drift inevitable drive monitorbecomes especially critical high recording densities used primarily large capacity mechanisms seems finding way smaller drives way boosting drive long term reliability mtbf ratingsfirst became aware thermal recalibration pointed technique conflicts prolonged write times digitizing say audio video hard diskmanufacturers explicitly state drives thermal recalibration used applications prolonged disk writeshope helps
