sure help local interstellar radiation field measured modeled various groupsremember things correctly models involved contributions three different bb sources obvious temperature background radiation local areahowever following references give interstellar radiation density function wavelength integrate average appropriate manner get effective temperature like witt johnson astrophysjhenry et alastrophysjmathis et alastronastrophyssee references date might get startedhope helps
