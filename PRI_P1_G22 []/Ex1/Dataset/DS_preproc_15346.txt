well actually quiteradar radio altimeters measure distances measuring time required transmit signal receive reflection targetradar generally uses pulses radio altimeters use either pulses modulated continuous wave transmissioncase latter highly accurate distance measurement madeexample original bendix ala radio altimeter accurate foot feet altitudenote however different method measuring poster originally askedproblem gaining accurate measurements transmitter seperate receiver need highly accurate time base starts receiver exact instant transmitter triggerscannot wire connected since radio waves actually travel faster free space air case wire difference called velocity factor cableneed resort common timebase automatically corrected distance etcsomething like pll connected gps receiver trick triggering transmitter receiver simultaneouslysound expensivebad plan spending bucks equipment effortgo different methodsurveyors use laser light system reflection time measuredtrysounds like something p eknow anywayactually highly inaccurate since power output transmitter varies unit unit variances antenna transmission line receiver may also vary unit unit unit timewould need continuously calibrate entire systemradio altimeter also done since everything located one place much easiernote especially time base r receiver transmitter one unit also nopefm capture effect says strongest signal winsunless two interfering signals seperated db signal strengthone problem makes altimeters inaccurate low altitudessignals bouncing runways tend strong high possible eliminate outside influence also enhance attenuation multipath signalsradio altimeters typically use frequencies around ghzhope helps
