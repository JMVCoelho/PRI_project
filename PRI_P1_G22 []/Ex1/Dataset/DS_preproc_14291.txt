remember formula hand awhile since took aerodynamics used stuff sincecd related drag force effects top speed fuel consumptiondrag force car aircraft greater vehicle engine overcome reached top speedautos course also overcome rolling resistance since drag opposes vehicle motion engine must make burning fuelanyway since geometery auto rather complex drag pressure coeffiecent etc either found experimentaly using numerical methodanyway flow around cylinder drag coeff cd q r drag force q flow velocity r radius clyinderget rough rough estimate set r car width q car speed knowing cd find drag force car would need overcome
