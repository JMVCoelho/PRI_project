note tried figure stuff month ago various people net could wrongdata ever read barring mistracks course eventually gets turned khz bit two channel dataoversampling takes two discrete data points interpolates n points n times oversamplingasked people said interpolation simply linear interpolation significantly complicatedanyway purpose oversampling move effective sampling rate n times khz order use higher frequency antialiasing filtersquality filter higher oversampling lets build cheaper filters whereas price filter higher oversamplings lets build better filtersassuming quality components cd player remained oversampling allow manufacturer produce _slightly_ better sound due anti alias filtering
