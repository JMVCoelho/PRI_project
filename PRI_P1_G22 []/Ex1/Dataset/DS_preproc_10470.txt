year ago started work problem appeared simple turned quite difficultwondering anyone net seen problem hopefully published solutionsproblem draw outline surface defined two roughly parallel cubic splinesinputs problem essentially starts two sets points set points edge object treat two dimensional eextant edges exists three dimensional spacedraw object fit cubic spline pointsspline effectively computed sequence line segments approximating curvespline equal number segmentsassume nth segment along spline roughly exactly distance along spline reasonable measuretake segment n along spline match nth segment opposing splineuse pair segments form two triangles filled color surfacedepth sort triangles take triangle sorted order project onto pixmap draw color triangletake edge triangle along edge surface draw line along edge colored special edge color edge coloring step heart problemidea effectively outline edge surfacenet result however generally lots breaks gaps edge surfacereasons fairly complicatedinvolve rasterization problems problems resulting projecting splinesanything problem sounds familiar would appreciate knowing work area
