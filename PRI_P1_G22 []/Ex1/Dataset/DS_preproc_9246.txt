ok asked new thread lines ask large hole current run thru resistor r cooling instead heatinganyone design amplifier preferentially amplifies hole currents normal electron currentssemiconductor materials highest ratio hole mobility electron mobilityplease quote actual test samples rather estimates based theoryalso limited semiconductors consider also insulators resistors dielectrics piezo electrics conductors magnets metal ceramic magnetostrictives etcnotes summarize thread far stated area holes detectable vacuumhole particles exist presence matterprevious threads stated holes exist certain semi conductorsquestion naturally arises hole currents inside semi conductor vanish point semiconductor joined conductor say copperwant theoretical discussion whether holes could exist inside metal conductors rather ask experimental discussion amplify detect currents existalso note cross posted sci electronics since becoming electronic discussionthanx ericet force nature
