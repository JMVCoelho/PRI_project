easy answer question depends whether display device hold pixmaps screen memory efficiently server manages resources deal limited screen memory bane server implementor existenceworked graphics devices screen memory main display copy rate eclipses main memory display copy rate main memory display faster screen display requires write framebuffer rather read f bfollowed write server uses cfb code something like render pixmaps cpu main memory rates get mit shm likely equal maybe tad slower depending os implementation shared memory copyarea pixmap window also copy cpu main memory graphics deviceone advanage mit shm images large end growing size server process holdone disadvantage mit shm sample implementation provision elegantly cleaning shared memory segments client dies sudden violent death e g killmindful cluttering system zombie shared memory segmentsken
