ahh perhaps astronomers built meter ground based scopes studying designs larger onesseriously though never going get meter scope orbit cheaply build one ground adaptive optics good site difference quality narrowed quite bit anywayalso scopes low orbit like hubble observe things continuously minutes time serious limitationsure hell point light half degree extent bright moonever noticed much brighter night sky moonlit nightexisting satellites points light advertising sign appeared point would useless rather think appear larger typical satellitealso satellite tracks ruining lots plates current palomar sky surveydeparment anyway philosophyobviously qualified speak astronomy
