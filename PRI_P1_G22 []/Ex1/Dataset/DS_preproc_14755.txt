one quick question throw guys class project need design build power supply following specs voltatge adjustable v current limited voltage must stay within designated value ac ripple less mv rms decide kind circuit must know initialprecission limiter current allowed temp driftfirst case use ube transistor voltage reference vdc temp drift mv ksecond case better use bandgap ref opamp circuit detect maximum currentoutput opamp controlls outputstage limit current
