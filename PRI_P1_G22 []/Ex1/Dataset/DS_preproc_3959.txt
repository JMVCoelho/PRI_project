true especially electrolytic capacitors high temperaturelow power quartz oscillators usually khz significant temperature drifts one often notice wearing watch one wristlow temperature sensitivity available crystal types unfortunately larger higher frequency mhz take battery powerprogrammable timers might less accurate power stingy suitable crystal oscillators
