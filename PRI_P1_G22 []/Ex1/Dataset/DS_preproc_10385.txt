archive name ripem attacks last update mar possible attacks ripem living list potential weaknesses keep eyes open using ripem secure electronic mailgo great detail almost certainly exhaustiveobviously many weaknesses weaknesses cryptographically secured mail general pertain secure mail programs ripemmaintained marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana eduposted monthly variety news groups followups pertaining specifically ripem go alt security ripemcryptanalysis attacks breaking rsa would allow attacker find private key case could read mail encrypted sign messages private keyrsa generally believed resistant standard cryptanalytic techniqueseven standard key bits ripem long enough render impractical barring huge investment hardware breakthrough factoringbreaking des would allow attacker read given message since message encrypted deswould allow attacker claimdes bits key thus could conceivably compromised brute force sufficient hardware agencies money devote simply read one messagesince message different des key work message would remain highkey management attacks stealing private key would allow benefits breaking rsasafeguard encrypted des key derived passphrase typehowever attacker get copy private keyfile passphrase snooping network packets tapping lines whatever could break whole schememain risk transferring either passphrase private key file across untrusted linkrun ripem trusted machine preferably one sitting right frontideally machine home maybe office nobody else physical accessfooling accepting bogus public key someone else could allow opponent deceive sending secret messages rather real recipientenemy fool intended recipient well could encrypt messages bogus public key pass alongimportant get proper public keys peoplecommon mechanism finger assuming opponent compromised routers daemons finger given fair amount truststrongest method key authentication exchange keys person however always practicalpeople vouch signing statement containing key possible although ripem features automatically pgpripem generate check md fingerprints public keys key files may exchanged via separate channel authenticationplayback attacks even opponent cannot break cryptography opponent could still cause difficultiesexample suppose send message mic pem mode provide disclosure protection alice says ok letopponent intercepts resends bob message authenticated tellingcourse may interpret entirely different contextopponent could transmit message recipient much later figuring would seen differently later timeopponent could change originator name register public key send message hoping recipient send return mail indicating perhaps even quotingunknown messagedefeat playback attacks plaintext message include indication sender recipient unique identifier typically dategood front end script ripem automatically imhorecipient sure originator name header sender indicated within plaintext really recipient message old onealso automatedauthor faq made modest attempt automating process generating checking encapsulated headers programs included standard distribution utils directorylocal attacks clearly security ripem cannot greater security machine encryption performedexample unix super user could manage get encrypted mail although would take planning effort something like replace ripem executable trojan horse get copy plaintext depending storedaddition link machine running ripem extensiondecrypt ripem remote machine connected via network worse yet modem eavesdropper could see plaintext probably also passphraseripem executed systems trust obviouslyextreme case ripem used machine total control nobody else access carefully examined software known free viruseshowever real trade convenience securitymoderately cautious user might use ripem unix workstation people access even root access increase security keeping private keys statically linked course executable floppy diskpeople keep ripem multi user system dialing insecure line download message system perform ripem decryptionhowever security provided mechanism somewhat illusory since presumably type cleartext password log given away store since attacker log install traps account steal private key next time use less insecure linelikely remain situation long systems use rather quaint mechanism cleartext password authenticationfind nice put brief statement carefully manage security arrangement plan next public key potential correspondents aware level precautions placepeople use two keys short one carefully managed ordinary use longer one treated greater care critical correspondenceuntrusted partner attacks ripem encryption ensure person private key corresponding public key used encrypt data may read traffichowever someone key gets message may always make whatever kind transformations wishesexist cryptographic barriers recipient say taking encrypted message converting mic message signed readable anyone although ripem provide functionalityindeed latest pem draft seen specifically states transformations possible allow forwarding functions work
