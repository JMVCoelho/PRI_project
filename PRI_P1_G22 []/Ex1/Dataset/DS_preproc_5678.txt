stuff deleted actually make reasonable amount sensefixed disk sectors buffered controller transferring memory rep insw whatever instruction called quite efficient single instruction goes fast controller cpu know use bussince cached bus likely critical resource relative cpu performance possible dma bus interference would cause much loss cpu cycles computing rep insw sequencefloppy hand buffered using cpu floppy data transfer done pc jr way really stink
