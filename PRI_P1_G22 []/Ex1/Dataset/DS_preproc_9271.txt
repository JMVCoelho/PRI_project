watching iisi speedup reports plan upgrade next weeksplan build small board different crystals able switch different speeds using front pannel switchway get speed want also run slower stock speeds experience compatability problems applicationsexpect able switch clock speeds system running switch without lock problems could switch mhz needed put back idle mhz needeedwould reduce wear tear cpu even heat sinkcourse would want run different clock signals switch use chip two board select frequency desired route directly mother boardstarted probing around inside si yetanyone know voltage level power crystal oscilators
