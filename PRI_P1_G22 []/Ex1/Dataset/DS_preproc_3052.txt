hi built valve preamp use diode capacitor voltage multiplier step vac supply voltage approx vdvload resistance increases rc constant decreases hence output voltage dropsneed high output voltage possiblevcircuit consists seven voltage multiplier stages ie diodes capacitors capacitor develops v across take output across seven capacitors vcapacitor mfd vincrease capacitors rating mfd increase rc constant hence alleviate problemcapacitors going little expensive needwould happen connected mfd v capacitor parallel output hence parallel seven mfd capacitorsassume increase c circuit hence increase rc time constantoutput voltage becomes stable killed two birds one stone experiencing hz ripple hence amp hum new capacitor smoothanyone recomend suitable value inductor choke placed output line power supply filter hz mains humlowest resistance possiblegot preamp moment much distraction university got get dissertation finished two weekshence mailing playing solderoing iron cheaper long run especially new large capacitors work plannedemail please always read netthanks advance chris name mr chris smith twang ole guitaraddrs scst uk ac liv csc uni liverpool university quest build hardware dgree computer science ever sun may certainly ball flaming gash lawrence
