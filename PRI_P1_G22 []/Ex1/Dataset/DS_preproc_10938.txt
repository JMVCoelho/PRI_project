may sound like simple minded question first time ever need designing relatively simple chip circuits based things like photoresistors know light photoresistor emit logic high etcanyway got servos lying around wanted things using digital logicknow pulse signal everything one problem assuming need negative yes negative logic high get thing turn direction opposite direction would turn normal logic highnegative logic high seen schematics thing active lowusing bi polar power source would get negative logic high thingneed three signals available logic high logic low negative logic highhelp would greatly appreciatedalso please reply via email never seem time read group latelythanks much mark
