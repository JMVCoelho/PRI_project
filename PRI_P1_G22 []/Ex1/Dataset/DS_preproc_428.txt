trying build circuit detects presence video vs blank screen monitoring r g b outputs graphics cardable detect presence single pixel mhz would mean detecting ns pulsealso able tell difference blank screen mv dim screen say around mvoh yes also needs cheapfirst circuit dismal failureused compariators compariator input going one guns input went reference created voltage divider potentiometerfirst problem compariator way slowneeded get several pixels row would fire compariators could whole screen full text circuit would detectsecond problem noise reference smallest difference blank screen dim screenfact difference completely black completely white mvwondering going amplify video signals make workfaster compariators expensive require split supplieswould need replace quad compariator three compariators create whole new power supply circuitpoint think need sort transistor circuittransistors fast cheap trickunfortunately way league comes designing transistor circuits appealing net helpideas tips circuits pointers references etcwould greatly appreciatedoh yes sample output thing every second need fast response time however found way take advantage factthanks lot help anybody might able givecourse undying gratitudesteve verity
