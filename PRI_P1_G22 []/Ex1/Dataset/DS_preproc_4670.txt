hello let introduce problem measure sinusoidal wave voltage digital voltmeter using ac mode output rms value peak value squaredrightmeasure square wave mode ac output equal peak value actually upper flat boundary waveassumed digital voltmeter makes kind integration input value divides wave periodright used measure square wave distorted high frequency harmonicsideally output output value previous onenature output valuevoltmeter actually measureshowrms readings unless dvm says measuring rms probably average voltageinput diode rectified measured dcsays rms measures square triangle etcincorrectly measuring average multipling correction true sine waves evave vrmswant correct rms waveform need true rms dvm dmm literally root mean square calculation either analog digital circuitryrelated question less important advantages disadvantages digital voltmeters compare analog oneslast significant advantage analog imo able see signal changing time e gchecking electrolytic capacitorsanymore dmm bargraphs etcduplicatethank attention could mail opinion avm zeus tamu edu open discussionwould appreciate either wayalexander v mamishev ____________________________________________________________________________ power system automation laboratory phone office department electrical engineering phone home texas university fax college station tx usa internet avm zeus tamu edu
