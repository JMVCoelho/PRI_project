zeno paradox resolved showing integration infinite series decreasing terms sum finite resultwell suppose probe emitting radiation constant frequency sent towards black holegot closer event horizon red shift would keep increasingperiod would get longer longer would never stopobserver would observe probe actually reaching event horizondetected energy probe would keep decreasing vanishexp never quite reaches zeroguess probably make things clear hopefully get general idea maybe
