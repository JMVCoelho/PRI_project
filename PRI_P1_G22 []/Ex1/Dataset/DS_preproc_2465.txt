one quick question throw guys class project need design build power supply following specs voltatge adjustable v current limited voltage must stay within designated value ac ripple less mv rms course use adjustable voltage current limiting regulator chip problem current limiting efound stuff rest parts circuitsupply must presented load would draw given supply voltage reduce voltage current equal one ampthus short thing ammeter read one ampmeasure current ohm resistor v read one amp output voltage necessity must vbasic idea seen current limiter involves circuit pull current base output power transistor therefore reduce outputanybody ideas could workthanks advanceandy collins kcyey acollins uclink berkeley edu
