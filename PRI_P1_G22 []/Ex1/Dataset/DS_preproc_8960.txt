ok fact two distinct components transmitted chip real message encrypted conventional key serial number encrypted conventional key encrypted imho kind bogus whole concept one key millions people use changed seem reasonable family keysuppose analyze output chip able determine bits encrypted packet contains serial number session keysuppose also design simple algorithm based information takes data containing encrypted session key twiddles bit several sent linemind sure nsa thought along dozen attacks imagine system probably somehow designed manipulation information cause compliant receiving chip somehow fail decrypt successfullytwo parties agree advance kind consistent bit twiddling scheme decryption chip sees restored proper bitstream eavesdropper gets e k uk packet wrongsuppose could easily defeated chip sends information many times slightly different ways making effectively impossible certain know information sent
