a major issue hanging over the census is resolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed overseas but congress is arguing over whether to keep counting illegal aliens the house blocked an effort tuesday to require aliens to be excluded from the census numbers used in house reapportionment every decade but the question still may be raised in committee and in the senate the national head count will be taken april census figures are used to redistribute the house seats among the states every years and to distribute federal aid to local governments the reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of house members from states where slow growth threatens to result in losses of house seats most of these states are in the north where growth has lagged behind that of the south and west undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the south west and industrial states like new york and other states fear a loss of power to those areas if the aliens are counted while aliens have been counted in the past military personnel stationed overseas have not the commerce department settled that problem by announcing it will work with the defense department on ways to count the million to million military and civilian defense workers who live overseas the problem has been in deciding which states may count these people as residents that has yet to be decided but possibilities include counting the state where the person owns a home or the last state where he or she lived for at least six months the battle over illegal aliens meanwhile was taken up both in committee and on the house floor rep tom ridge r pa unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban on counting aliens to an appropriations measure providing million to run the state justice and commerce departments next year including million to take the census the bill was approved and sent to the senate opponents noted the constitution requires house seats to be apportioned based on all the persons residing in a state every census since the constitution was created has counted all residents of the states both citizens and non citizens observed rep don edwards d calif congress is empowered to identify those to be counted in the census responded ridge the census bureau s billion budget for the census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegal aliens he said rep mervyn dymally d calif charged the debate is really over population shifts that will lead to more house seats for southern and western states pennsylvania i do n t care what they do unless they go down to the southwest and bring the people back they re going to lose a seat said dymally rep tim valentine d n c said however that counting illegal aliens is not fair it may be constitutional but it s just not right census officials generally have opposed any attempt to delete illegal aliens contending they can not determine who is in the country legally asking people about their status likely would result in people lying or refusing to participate in the count officials say resulting in a potential undercount of residents in many areas
