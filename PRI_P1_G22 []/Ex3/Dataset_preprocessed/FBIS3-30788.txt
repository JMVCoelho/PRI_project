language serbo croatian article type bfn lsb article by verica rudar what is ljubljana s message for belgrade rsb lsb text rsb in the view of yugoslav diplomats the normalization of relations between slovenia and the federal republic of yugoslavia will certainly be a strenuous and long term project although the establishment of communications between ljubljana and belgrade would be very important for the situation in the former yugoslavia in general the chances that this could happen soon are minimal a signal that relations between yugoslavia and slovenia might be reconsidered came this time from the slovene capital according to information published in the yugoslav newspapers the slovene government could be addressing this issue soon the establishing of relations between the two states the exchange of diplomatic representatives and the abolition of the visa requirement for yugoslav citizens are some of the topics to be considered this information has not been denied and apart from that it is the logical conclusion to a series of statements issued by slovene politicians which pointed to a change in relations toward belgrade the announcement about the normalization of relations were also supported by information that an official slovene delegation had arrived in belgrade for this purpose but it was stated that the details can not yet be published since the matter is very delicate the fry ministry of foreign affairs is denying that any official slovene delegation came to belgrade it is stated that this is rather a visit of businessmen since these contacts have not been interrupted it is assumed in the federal ministry of foreign affairs that slovene businessmen might even be checking the atmosphere for possible political contacts but there have been no official statements about it commercial contacts the signals from the slovene side are being received in yugoslavia with reservations one could even say with distrust yugoslav diplomats point out that yugoslavia has not been officially recognized by slovenia it is also true that slovenia does not accept yugoslavia on the international scene yugoslav sources claim that slovenia is becoming increasingly isolated because of its extreme policy toward yugoslavia so that this might be one of the reasons why it has decided to soften its attitudes toward yugoslavia official belgrade has not forgotten the extremist anti serbian statements issued by milan kucan in albania or the moves made by slovene statesmen who instead of soothing the passions stirred them up always to serbia s disadvantage after reporters remarked that this relatively negative attitude might negate the unofficial signal from ljubljana a yugoslav diplomat said we do not think that there is only one opinion in slovenia about yugoslavia slovenia is the former yugoslav republic that made the greatest effort to harm the federal republic of yugoslavia i am now speaking about the official slovene attitude not about the attitudes of all the politicians and especially not about the attitudes of the slovene people yugoslav diplomats have the impression that there are differences between milan kucan the president of slovenia lojze peterle the minister of foreign affairs and janez drnovsek the prime minister the last being sober realistic and trustworthy the first signs of a change in the slovene attitude toward yugoslavia were noticed during the visit of karolos papoulias the greek foreign minister and vaclav havel the czech president to slovenia in november diplomatic pirouettes at that time the press carried statements made by milan kucan and lojze peterle that unquestionably represented a shift in policy toward belgrade kucan said that slovenia never had any conflict with serbia and peterle that slovenia would be happy if the conditions for the removal of the sanctions against serbia and montenegro were fulfilled at the beginning of december mr peterle the slovene minister of foreign affairs made that attitude concrete in a letter to warren christopher the u s secretary of state in which he wrote a possible removal of the sanctions against yugoslavia is being fully considered since the aims for which they were introduced have not been achieved the european union initiative makes us hope that the situation in the balkans can be solved in the view of slovene political commentators the softening of the slovene attitude toward the fry is a part of the diplomatic tactics the aim of which is to adapt slovene policy to the policy of the european union with which slovenia is awaiting negotiations about associate membership belgrade diplomats agree with this assessment and claim that the first announcement of possible contacts between yugoslavia and slovenia were made by arrangement with germany and austria in the focus of serbian attention now are relations with croatia and as far as slovenia is concerned the official proposal for the normalization of relations has to be specified first single statements and diplomatic pirouettes are not enough to overcome the present differences including the slovene attitude toward kosovo the interruption of economic relations the way slovene independence was achieved by force and diplomatic duels on the international scene lsb box p rsb jovanovic slovenia must excuse itself in order to enter the process of normalization of relations with slovenia certain conditions must be fulfilled first vladislav jovanovic fry minister of foreign affairs said in a statement for politika and added first it is necessary for slovenia to excuse itself for the rude and impertinent move it made a year ago in refusing the yugoslav offer of recognizing slovenia it is further necessary that the anti serbian campaign that slovenia has been spreading all over the world is ended and that it acknowledges that those who remained in yugoslavia have the right to self determination apart from that slovenia must stop challenging the continuity of yugoslavia as a state slovenia made a mistake by insisting that the fry be excluded from all international forums in addition slovenia supports the lifting of the arms embargo on the bosnia herzegovina muslims there are many situations that prove that slovenia has a hostile attitude toward yugoslavia we are not bothered that slovenia is an independent state on the contrary while we lived together we had excellent relations that is why our surprise was great when the turnaround occurred yugoslavia is interested in good relations with all of its neighbors old and new alike slovenia is no exception we can not account for the hostility that they have shown toward yugoslavia and toward the people who are living in this region now official slovenia should find ways and means to end this hostility we are of course interested in normal relations between slovenia and yugoslavia but some prerequisites have to be fulfilled jovanovic concluded his statement
