president bill clinton s pledge to end welfare as we know it was one of the most popular lines in last year s election campaign his idea of a strict two year time limit on welfare cheques appealed to voters lrb especially reagan democrats rrb not just as a way of cutting government spending and thus reducing taxes but as a solution to the nation s most pressing social problems in the american mind welfare has become synonymous with such evils as urban decay fatherless children drug abuse and violent crime by promising radical welfare reform mr clinton was sending a powerful subliminal message he would wage war on all the diseases that are ravaging urban society since becoming president mr clinton has barely mentioned the word welfare raising fears that his grandiose promise will prove as cynical as former president george bush s read my lips no new taxes pledge the white house insists that welfare reform is not forgotten but has just had to take its turn behind two even more urgent priorities the deficit reduction plan finally approved this month and the healthcare reform scheduled for september it claims both measures will help shift people off welfare by making work pay the budget advanced this cause by expanding the earned income tax credit lrb a kind of negative income tax rrb this gives poor working families a cash bonus of up to dollars a year increasing the incentive to take low paid jobs if healthcare reform guarantees health insurance for all workers welfare recipients will no longer be able to reject jobs on the grounds that they stand to lose their health care benefits in addition the administration promises to bolster the economic position of welfare mothers by strictly enforcing laws requiring absent fathers to support their children financially such measures should help but they are hardly going to solve america s welfare problem which differs substantially from that in europe in keeping with franklin roosevelt s dictum that a permanent dole is a narcotic a subtle destroyer of the human spirit the us has never provided permanent welfare support for single able bodied adults when pundits talk of a culture of welfare they are referring mainly to the dollars bn spent on aid for families with dependent children a benefit received by m single parent families the objection is not that some families in straitened circumstances need afdc as a short term prop but that half of those on welfare behave as though they have a meal ticket for life so what should mr clinton do many conservatives favour the concept of a strict time limit once people accept that benefits are not going to be paid indefinitely they argue behaviour will change teenagers will stop having babies and start recognising the economic advantages of marriage those whose welfare benefits expire will face a stark choice accept low paid employment or hand over children for adoption at first the adjustment will be horribly painful but in the longer term society will gain enormously because destructive lifestyles will no longer be underwritten with its economic life support system lrb welfare rrb ripped away the underclass will shrivel but no modern president would contemplate so brutal a social experiment if welfare stops something has to take its place one suggestion is that mr clinton should follow the example of roosevelt s works progress administration an agency that at its peak created over m public sector jobs after two years welfare cheques would thus be replaced by the offer of a government job at slightly below the private sector minimum wage mothers with young children would also be offered state child care facilities according to one advocate this would amount to replacing the welfare state by the work ethic state this solution is more appealing than a mere cessation of benefits but it would involve a huge expansion of public sector employment and cost perhaps dollars bn a year far more than the clinton administration is willing to spend on welfare reform fortunately there is a fall back position for mr clinton the bipartisan family support act of which he helped steer through congress this recognised the impossibility of ending welfare overnight and instead set targets for the gradual introduction of workfare next year states will receive federal assistance only if they ensure that at least per cent of the em ployable welfare case load is working or in training programmes by the required ratio rises to per cent these seemingly undemanding targets require a much larger fraction of the welfare population to take jobs at some point during the year mr clinton could tighten the definition of em ployable so as to include mothers with children under the age of three and set more demanding workfare participation targets for example that per cent of welfare recipients should be working or in training by the year such a gradualist approach would be both humane and cost effective the only trouble is that it falls far short of the presidential promise to end welfare as we know it like mr bush mr clinton may have raised expecta tions that simply can not be met
