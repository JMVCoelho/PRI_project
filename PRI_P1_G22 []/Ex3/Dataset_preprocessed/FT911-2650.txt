how can civil servants mostly based in washington best promote development in the third world that is the vexing question facing mr lewis preston the former chairman of j p morgan the new york bank who takes over as president of the world bank this september as bankers and finance ministers gathered in washington this weekend for the spring meetings of the bank and international monetary fund there was no shortage of advice the us treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector the bank is also under pressure to follow the example of mr jacques attali s european bank for reconstruction and development lrb ebrd rrb and attach strict political conditions to its loans development economists meanwhile are urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year s world development report and focus more on poverty alleviation mr preston may relax on one count few in washington now doubt that the bank is needed new imperatives such as reconstruction in eastern europe and the middle east have merely been superimposed on older unsolved problems grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world bn people live on less than dollars a day more than m third world children lack access even to primary education horrific inequality abounds in mexico life expectancy for the poorest per cent is years less than for the richest per cent what kind of bank will mr preston inherit from his predecessor mr barber conable most reports are mixed it is not an impressive bureaucracy says mr john williamson a senior fellow at the institute for international economics the morale of staff is lousy says mr charles flickner a senior analyst on the senate budget committee and close observer of the bank mr conable a former republican congressman arrived at the bank in knowing little about either banking or development although now well liked lrb partly for championing causes such as women s rights in the third world rrb many observers say he never fully recovered from a rocky start involving a divisive internal reorganisation of the bank mr percy mistry a scholar at queen elizabeth house oxford and former senior adviser at the bank says it suffered from presidential failure during the s mr robert mcnamara a forceful chief executive in the s built a presidential institution that responded to firm leadership from the top but neither mr conable nor his predecessor mr a w tom clausen a commercial banker could fill his shoes for a decade the bank has effectively been run by two senior and strong willed vice presidents mr ernest stern lrb who nearly left last year to join the ebrd rrb and mr moeen qureshi mr preston s first challenge says mr mistry will be to wrest control of the bank from messrs stern and qureshi his second to prune legions of useless advisers and install managers with real world experience his third one might add will be quickly to establish his independence from the us treasury which always browbeats a newcomer what kind of development legacy will mr preston inherit in spite of recent progress in a few countries such as mexico the past decade has been one of relative failure many third world countries have gone backwards real per capita incomes have declined substantially in sub saharan africa and the middle east and mildly in latin america the biggest drag on growth is the huge debt accumulated in the s and early s many optimists see the debt reduction strategy launched by mr nicholas brady the us treasury secretary in as a final solution to the debt crisis under the plan official agencies assume some of the burden of developing countries private debts on condition that they implement market oriented economic reforms the brady plan is enough says mr williamson if developing countries are willing to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness of official debt officials such as mr david mulford of the us treasury say the recent forgiveness of about half of poland s official debt will not set a precedent for other debtors mr williamson laughs in the long run it will be impossible to isolate poland he says it is not so much more deserving than other countries but why was a brady type solution not launched much earlier for most of the s the first world doggedly refused to consider debt forgiveness the result of delay and compound interest is a total debt burden today of some dollars bn compared with a relatively manageable dollars bn in the bank failed to take a timely leadership position on the debt crisis concludes mr richard feinberg director of the overseas development council in washington lrb the imf was equally short sighted rrb as incoming president mr preston must review the bank s strategies for promoting development the main innovation of the s was a switch from project lending to structural adjustment lending making finance conditional on structural reforms was supposed to transform the economic performance of developing countries but studies indicate the results have been fairly unimpressive this is both because countries failed to abide by the loan conditions and because the bank s policies were sometimes misguided professor john toye director of the institute for development studies at sussex university recently completed an exhaustive analysis of bank programmes he concludes lrb as do internal bank analyses rrb that policy based lending has achieved something particularly in relation to the external account but not nearly as much as the bank and donor community hoped on average programmes have reduced balance of payments gaps had a negligible impact on gross national product and led to falls in the ratio of investment to gnp mr feinberg calls the decline in investment the great shortcoming of structural adjustment lending in the s lrb investment to gnp ratios have fallen markedly in africa the middle east and latin america rrb he says the bank was naive to expect entrepreneurs to respond to the austerity of adjustment by increasing investment how can the bank do better in the s one problem is that it has lost leverage over many third world governments the maturing of bank programmes and the failure to expand lending much in the s has led to a marked shrinkage in its net transfers to developing countries according to mr lawrence summers the bank s chief economist net transfers over the next five years will be about dollars per person in the developing world compared with dollars lrb in current prices rrb in the late s for the large number of countries that do not qualify for concessional loans the net flow will be negative some analysts including us treasury officials believe lacklustre performance in much of the third world reflects the inefficiency lrb and sometimes corruption rrb of governments the ebrd s constitution requires borrowers to be committed to and applying the principles of multi party democracy pluralism and market economics it also says per cent of ebrd resources must be devoted to the commercial sector private businesses and state concerns in the process of privatisation the world bank operates under very different rules its charter requires it to be non political and only its small affiliate the international finance corporation lrb ifc rrb can make direct loans to private businesses should the bank s charter be amended direct parallels between the bank and the ebrd are dubious the ebrd is ministering to a region that has historical ties with western europe and that has declared its commitment to democracy and free markets such values are alien in many developing countries but that does not imply they should be denied the means for economic development if strict political conditionality had been imposed in the past the bank could not have lent to a development star such as south korea most analysts however say the bank should tighten up a little mr flickner of the senate budget committee says the issue is not whether to insist on westminster style democracy but whether the form of governance is such that loans will benefit the majority of the people bank officials say greater attention will be paid to issues such as the rule of law and transparency of decision taking should a significant chunk of the bank s loans be made direct to the private sector mr conable to his credit is resisting the us treasury s pressure he says the bank s main aim is to combat poverty and that it will seek a balanced relationship between government and the market in developing countries in reality much of the most badly needed investment is in spheres such as infrastructure health care and education where governments play a dominant role even in industrialised countries indeed one conclusion of prof toye s analysis is that policy based loans would have a greater chance of success if they included measures to expand the role of the state in poorer countries alongside measures to promote economic liberalisation sir william ryrie the head of the ifc says the objective of a large volume of public lending to the private sector is wrong headed what we are trying to do is facilitate the flow of private sector funds into sound investments advocates of a switch to direct support of the private sector are surely not arguing for public subsidies for third world entrepreneurs but if subsidies are ruled out why should the bank s judgment of market risk be more reliable than that of private lenders in the west there are alternative recipes for fostering faster third world development during the s the bank placed great faith in free market nostrums it wanted to impose on developing countries policies that had become recently fashionable in the industrialised world but the notion that economic liberalisation alone is sufficient is increasingly questioned the bank s own research department is highlighting the need to relieve poverty directly and to improve fundamentals such as education nutrition and health care liberalisation matters says mr williamson at the institute for international economics but education is more important he argues that the best way of stimulating growth and improving income distribution is to put resources into education and primary health care mr feinberg at the overseas development council broadly agrees the bank has got to find a way of melding equity and efficiency as it promotes development the challenge for mr preston is clear put the sterile ideological battles of the s behind the bank and develop policies that put greater emphasis on the formation of human capital mr summers the bank s economist says pessimistically that because development money will be in short supply over the next decade the bank and other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas ideas are certainly important but they do not build hospitals or schools more money could be made available a mere per cent cut in western defence spending for example would pay for a doubling of official aid rather than tamely accepting the status quo mr preston could use his platform to promote a more constructive attitude in
