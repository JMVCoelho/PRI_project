central american and caribbean governments are awaiting with more than passing interest an imminent us statement on measures to cushion the economic dislocation which the region expects from the north american free trade agreement however washington s proposals promised by mr alexander watson assistant secretary of state for inter american affairs are likely to disappoint caribbean basin governments which have been seeking a comprehensive package to allow free access to the us and canadian markets the us proposals could also be at a cost to the region say some caribbean officials claiming that a more competitive mexico with free access to the us and canada will capture markets which caribbean basin countries have developed under current trade agreements the region has asked for parity with mexico in exporting to nafta signatories some regional government officials and us legislators supportive of the caribbean s concerns which include the possible diversion of investments to mexico have now concluded that what would amount to a de facto extension of nafta is unlikely they believe that the us administration would not again willingly confront the coalition of opposition which fought the implementing legislation last november the measures to be announced by the us are a result of discussions last year between president bill clinton and leaders from the caribbean and central america mr clinton and his mexican counterpart mr carlos salinas assured the caribbean basin countries that they would not be adversely affected by the implementation of nafta and that efforts would be made to protect their markets in the us and canada what the caribbean basin countries want is quick action by legislators in washington and then in ottawa and mexico city to ratify proposals by some us congressmen to put all the region s exports to the us and canada on a par with mexico s the parity proposals are aimed at giving caribbean basin countries an open door to the nafta market for three years during this time they would have the opportunity of negotiating their future trade relationship with the nafta signatories with the option of seeking membership either as individual states or as a group president clinton has said his administration will ensure that the benefits of nafta are felt by the caribbean countries said mr manuel esquivel prime minister of belize we are heartened by president salinas assurances that it is not mexico s intention to take investments away from the caribbean but we remain apprehensive there is yet no indication of what the us administration will propose for the caribbean basin mr edwin carrington secretary general of the caribbean community lrb caricom rrb said he expected parity to be given to only a few of the region s exports including textiles the parity issue which is the first step we are seeking is becoming a case of limited benefits for a very great price he said while willing to give parity to a few products the us wanted the caribbean basin countries to meet new conditions including bilateral investment treaties intellectual property rights agreements workers rights and environmental legislation democracy good governance and accountability mr carrington said the costs of parity are much higher than we anticipated and any thoughts of full membership of nafta are as far down the road as they ever were in presenting their case for parity caribbean leaders have argued that the us and canada will also be the losers if there is extensive economic dislocation in the region caused by a loss of markets to mexico mr p j patterson jamaica s prime minister claimed that many jobs in the us depended on trade flows between that country and the caribbean region each dollars bn of us exports to the region creates new jobs in the us he said in the past years us exports to the caribbean basin have doubled making the region the tenth largest market for us exporters as caribbean economies grow our ability to absorb us exports will also increase currently cents of every dollar earned by the caribbean returns to the us through the purchase of us goods compared with only cents for each dollar spent by asia this is why we must pursue efforts to ensure that the question of the granting of parity be given early and positive consideration without improved access to the us and canadian markets to counter mexico s benefits under nafta the caribbean basin countries will have to continue depending on their current trade preference agreements with the us and canada the benefits from these were diminishing said mr carrington as the region s exports became less competitive and mexican products enjoyed the benefits of the market the nafta playing field will never be level for the region he said nobody is going to give us an even playing field but we have to work to make it less uneven
