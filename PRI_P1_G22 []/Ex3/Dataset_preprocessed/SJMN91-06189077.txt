while angel and his followers meditate to prepare for their journey french new age musician jean michel jarre is coordinating an elaborate sound and light show to play at the foot of the pyramids in teotihuacan north of the capital also on e day july crowded cruise ships will linger off mexico s pacific coast and thousands of u s tourists will drive south into baja california which usually boasting clear skies is being billed as the world s most promising site from which to view nature s own light show eclipse fans from japan to new york to the netherlands are expected in droves but californians because of their proximity to baja and propensity for mystical phenomena should be conspicuous however the chic hot spot for eclipse watchers wo n t be mexico but the big island of hawaii where the tourists who would be there anyway to enjoy the sunshine will be joined by an additional or more coming to watch the sun go out for four minutes even more people might be there for the show but for the lack of seats on flights to the island most visitors will be funneled in through the relatively small airport at kailua airlines are adding scores of flights to ferry thousands of people from neighboring islands in the hours just before the eclipse car rental companies have shipped in or so extra cars more than one caller from the mainland has asked the visitors bureau whether the island is in danger of tipping over under the tourists weight but mexico will host the biggest share of travelers partly because of its easy access from the united states and partly since the eclipse will last longest here up to seven minutes which is three more minutes than the maximum length in hawaii this will also be the longest lasting total eclipse until according to alan dyer an associate editor at astronomy magazine the midday eclipse will consist of a mile wide lunar shadow speeding at up to miles per hour along the earth s surface while many mexicans are looking forward to the event some are quietly taking precautions in pre colombian times eclipses were viewed as bad omens by the sun worshiping aztecs in the capital s sonora market specializing in magic vendors have stocked up on garlic bulbs tied with red ribbon which they hawk as protection from the bad vibrations of the eclipse a thriving trade is also taking place in magnets for those with low blood pressure to carry in their pockets on july and old copper coins for pregnant women to place as charms in their belly buttons as in hawaii mexico could probably use some otherworldly intervention to cope with the scores of thousands of tourists who have already started arriving in the southern half of the baja peninsula some hotels have had rooms reserved for more than a year all are now booked up and authorities fear competition at campsites we re worried that californians will drive down on the spur of the moment without taking water or fuel said marivi lerdo who promotes tourism to mexico in new york although hawaii s isolation will limit the size of the crowds locals are still predicting problems by god there s just one road on this island a circle route that often narrows to two lanes one shop owner said it s going to be total insanity we re worrying that we wo n t have enough alcohol and food on the island said the manager of a local restaurant and disco called the eclipse named by coincidence years
