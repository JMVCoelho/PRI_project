a long beach bound exxon oil tanker ran aground on a reef friday and spilled an estimated million gallons of crude oil into alaska s prince william sound a pristine pacific waterway heavily used by kayakers fishermen and tourists it was the largest alaskan oil spill ever the exxon valdez a foot tanker owned by exxon shipping co rammed the reef about miles from the city of valdez the northernmost ice free port in the united states at a m coast guard officers speculated that the ship s captain may have been trying to avoid icebergs from the nearby columbia glacier when the accident occurred leak a mere trickle a representative of the u s fish and wildlife service said the tanker had been spilling oil at a rate of barrels an hour but the coast guard said the leak had become a mere trickle by p m alaska time u s coast guard petty officer john gonzales said in a telephone interview from valdez that the spill was staying in the mid channel and did not seem to be moving toward the shore we ve had no report of any wildlife hurt at this time he said but environmentalists feared that if the oil reached the shore marine birds would be threatened herring hatch at this time of year and attract up to sea birds for the feast environmentalists also expressed concern about whales sea lions and other wildlife twenty people were aboard the ship but there were no immediate reports of injuries said dave parish a spokesman for exxon usa in a telephone interview from anchorage he said three planes from british columbia california and england had been dispatched to the scene for aerial spraying to dilute the oil gonzales said barrels spilled into the sea another exxon tanker was attempting to pump the oil out of the crippled vessel and two coast guard investigators were on board the valdez he said jon nelson a deputy regional director of the u s fish and wildlife service in anchorage said the reef ripped a foot gash in the vessel which was carrying million barrels of oil and there was fear that the tanker could break apart further if it breaks up on the rocks then anything could happen he said in a telephone interview the seas were calm friday and the forecast was for continued calm until sunday infuriated local residents and environmentalists complained about the slow pace of the cleanup critical of efforts where was the crackerjack response team that was supposed to be out there they are moving way too slowly said university of alaska professor richard steiner who flew over the slick friday there lrb was rrb no oil lrb cleanup equipment rrb out there and it s been hours since it happened it is huge literally huge he said in a telephone interview from cordova it looks devastating the slick is probably five miles long by three miles wide fortunately there is no wind we saw six sea lions inside the slick swimming trying to avoid it and they had no idea which way to go cindy lowry alaska regional director for greenpeace also complained about the pace of the cleanup it is more than hours later and there is no lrb cleanup rrb boom no sweepers they are bringing equipment from as far away as england it is just absurd that the equipment is not here already this will affect everything in the food chain from crab larvae to orca whales exxon s parish said everything possible was being done it takes time to get activated he said the immediate response to the spill was handled by crews from the terminal at valdez floating oil booms gonzales the coast guard spokesman said the terminal has cleanup equipment on site for minor spills he said employees of the alyeska pipeline service co which operates the trans alaska oil pipeline for a consortium of oil companies were getting floating oil booms in place by late afternoon prince william sound home to orcas sea otters and fur seals is important to both the fishing and the recreation industries it s a gorgeous marine environment and ecosystem with lots of little islands and inlets and bays said emily barneet alaska issues specialist for the sierra club in anchorage it s also a pretty well established tourist attraction with sailing and glacier viewing trips prince william is a gem the spill is expected to add fuel to a campaign by environmentalists to prevent further oil development in alaska particularly in the arctic national wildlife refuge it s of concern for two reasons one is the size of the spill and that this is such a sensitive very productive area said lisa speer senior staff scientist with the natural resources defense council in new york this is a consequence of north slope oil development that is rarely mentioned valdez city manager doug griffen told the associated press that the mile trans alaska pipeline which carries oil from prudhoe bay to valdez and the marine terminal has a good environmental record expected worst but this could be a catastrophic occurrence so we re concerned he said living in valdez we ve always worried that sometime something like this could happen alaska gov steve cowper arrived in valdez on friday to evaluate the spill he said that state officials were considering the use of chemicals to disperse and sink the oil the problem is that chemical use can have a bad effect on marine life he said it s going to be a tough judgment call cowper said that conventional responses such as booms probably would not work because the spill is so large you probably could n t do it lrb contain the spill rrb with all the equipment available in north america this is a major spill by any reckoning we ve been able to brag for a long time that there s never been a major oil spill in valdez harbor now we ca n t do that anymore
