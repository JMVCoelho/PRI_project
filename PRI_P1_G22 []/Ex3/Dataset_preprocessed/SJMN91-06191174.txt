it s maybe the greatest natural occurrence one can witness said larry toy a chabot college astronomy professor the phenomenon is just awe inspiring solar eclipses occur twice a year when the sun moon and earth line up lrb this line up would occur at every new moon except that the moon s orbit is tilted so it only crosses the sun s path every six months rrb because of variations in the moon s orbit fewer than a third of the solar eclipses are total eclipses in these cases the moon s shadow up to miles wide on the earth s surface races west to east along the ground at to miles per hour for a few thousand miles most total eclipses get little public attention they occur over water over the poles or in difficult to reach terrain on average any point on earth is eclipsed just once every years but when the shadow s narrow path does cross inhabited areas people flock there to experience totality to watch the light snap off and the stars snap on and to gaze at the sun s shaggy corona hanging in the dark sky for a few minutes before daylight abruptly returns in the united states the opportunity has come twice in the past couple of decades along the east coast in and across the northwest and northern plains in this thursday the moon s shadow will be back for another performance one of the century s best it s unusual for several reasons at its peak observers will see one of the longest lasting eclipses this century six minutes seconds also its mile wide path across hawaii baja california mexico city and four central american capital cities puts more people in the moon s shadow than any other eclipse in history says alan dyer an editor of astronomy magazine finally since the center of the shadow will pass right across the world s largest cluster of astronomical observatories the audience will include several dozen solar scientists intent on getting the best view they ve ever had it s going to be great from up there on the mountain said harold zirin a california institute of technology astronomer who will be at one of the observatories atop mauna kea a dormant volcano that makes up a large piece of the island of hawaii historic events for science two eclipses have proved especially historic in spectroscopic study of the sun s halo turned up evidence of a new element which was named helium from helios the greek sun god and in astronomers spotted a star which should have been behind the sun instead peeking around the edge of the sun that was the first confirmation of albert einstein s prediction that a star s gravity will bend the path of light but in recent years solar eclipses have declined in significance for researchers for one thing chasing eclipses by trekking to remote regions with delicate astronomical instruments to capture a few minutes of data has lost much of its glamour especially in times of tight budgets for another some of the information now can be gathered any day of the year by using instruments that simulate a solar eclipse but this time the eclipse is coming to them and they ca n t resist a look at feet mauna kea is the world s tallest island mountain the air above it is still dry and clean making it one of the world s choicest spots for viewing the cosmos it s so high that oxygen deprivation is a serious concern and unlike most people headed for hawaii astronomers will be packing long underwear and down jackets in case as sometimes happens even in july the temperature at the summit drops below freezing observatories in use seven of the nine observatories atop mauna kea will be used thursday morning lrb the keck observatory being built by the university of california and the california institute of technology is behind its original construction schedule and will not be completed in time for the eclipse rrb what they want to know is more about the temperature and composition of the sun s upper atmosphere layers called the chromosphere and the corona which normally is difficult to examine against the glare of the sun they hope the information will provide clues to what causes the sun s year cycle of sunspots and flares lrb now near its peak rrb what propels the solar wind and why the sun s outer atmosphere is paradoxically so much hotter than its lower atmosphere solar wind studies at some observatories astronomers will take repeated photographs of the corona during the eclipse to study it close up and to watch for material accelerating outward to become solar wind others will use telescopes to study the sun s emissions at microwave frequencies to learn more details about how its temperature varies with altitude but frankly the astronomers also want to watch the lights go out they ll be fighting the temptation to abandon their instruments and go outside to watch the biggest problem zirin said is whether we re going to see the eclipse
