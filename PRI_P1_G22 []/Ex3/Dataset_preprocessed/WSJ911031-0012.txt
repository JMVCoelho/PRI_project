state statutes that bar first time candidates from running for congress have been held to add to the qualifications set forth in the constitution and have been invalidated for example the decision in dillon v fiorina struck down a new mexico law requiring candidates entering a congressional primary to have belonged to their party for a year and to pay a registration fee but state statutes that simply limit the tenure of existing congressional officeholders have not yet been tested in court the constitutionality of such state term limits may however be tested next month florida s attorney general has asked its state supreme court for an advisory opinion on a term limit initiative that would limit the state s members of congress to eight consecutive years in office three u s house members led by democrat larry smith have filed briefs asking the court to rule state term limits unconstitutional the court will hear arguments friday and may rule later this month by to the california supreme court ruled this month that the state s new term limit law was constitutional the court said the state s strong interests in protecting against an entrenched dynastic legislative bureaucracy outweighed objections that term limits restrict voter choice at the ballot box but the court s decision affected only term limits on state officials federal officeholders were n t included in california s limits nevertheless the california decision demolished many of the legal arguments made by incumbents they claimed there is a fundamental right to be a candidate for public office which they found among the associational rights in the first amendment they argued that voters were denied the right to be represented by the same legislator indefinitely and that term limits discriminated against incumbents and denied them their right to equal protection of the laws california s highest court rejected all of these arguments term limitations do not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of his or her ideology or party therefore they do not deprive voters of the freedom to associate with candidates based on their viewpoint or with any particular party rather they prevent citizens from voting for a particular candidate after he has served in office a set number of years they may vote for that candidate again after a waiting period has ended the restriction is imposed in a non discriminatory manner on all candidates regardless of viewpoint or party affiliation in its decision bullock v carter and again in its decision clements v fashing the u s supreme court determined that a particular candidate has no fundamental right to ballot access or to run for office federal courts have upheld many state restrictions on who may qualify for ballot access they have never held reasonable non discriminatory restrictions on who may run a violation of the right to vote likewise term limits do not violate the equal protection clause of the th amendment the supreme court has found that clause violated only in those cases where ballot access restrictions discriminate against the poor and against new small or independent party candidates unlike the age residency and citizenship requirements term limits do not prevent any non incumbent from running for congress nor do they prevent a house member who has reached a term limit from running for the u s senate or vice versa nor do they limit an incumbent who leaves office for a period of time lrb six years in washington state rrb from running again moreover term limits do not in any way modify the age residency or citizenship requirements in the constitution consequently the argument that term limits are qualifications just like those already in the constitution and that therefore they can be added only by amending the constitution is n t particularly convincing viewed in this way term limits imposed by states would be constitutional the supreme court has long held that the power to ensure a fair electoral system truly responsive representation in congress and a high degree of citizen participation in elections rests with the states in its decision storer v brown the supreme court upheld a california law that prohibited an independent candidate from running for congress because he had changed his registration to independent less than months before the election this law was found not to be an improper additional qualification because a valid state interest was pursued in explaining that interest the court recognized that there must be a substantial regulation of elections lcb by the states rcb if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order is to accompany the democratic process as recently as june of this year the supreme court again reiterated that the states have reserved to themselves via the tenth amendment the power to regulate elections elsewhere the court in ruled in south carolina v baker that certain extraordinary defects in the national political process might render congressional regulation of state activities invalid under the tenth amendment the court has not defined what it means by extraordinary defects but surely the fact that of house incumbents are routinely re elected and that one out of five incumbents ran with no major party opposition in might qualify where the incumbent is almost the pre ordained winner in an election there is no effective competition of ideas or candidates and incumbents are less responsive to the will of the electorate on this basis term limits merely ensure a fair election system and the republican form of government guaranteed the states under the constitution should the court rule against term limits by the states numerous other ballot access restrictions will likely be passed that have many of the same effects as term limits one option would limit an incumbents access to the ballot states could allow an incumbent who has served a set number of years in the same office to run again but only as a write in candidate presumably if an incumbent were truly effective and popular he would n t find that a crushing obstacle two sitting u s house members won their first terms as write in candidates incumbents would certainly have the resources to educate voters in write in procedures another option would require candidates to have ballot statements appear next to their names each candidate would have to answer the question will you adhere to a year term limit the answer would appear on the ballot so voters would know a candidate s views on term limits many such ballot restrictions have been upheld by the courts incumbents should take heed if they count only on the courts to safeguard their political castles they may be in for a rude surprise
