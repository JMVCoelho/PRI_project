they d sell off bits of the white house lawn for a vote if they could jim jontz head of the fair trade campaign against nafta it s one president all the living former presidents governors nobel laureates and economists versus perot buchanan and brown it s your choice mickey kantor us trade representative barring the unforeseen the latest addition to the matriarchy of all political battles will be finally decided on november when democrats republicans and one independent in the member house of representatives lrb there is one vacant seat rrb vote on whether to approve the north american free trade agreement linking the us mexico and canada on january a simple majority of is all that is needed if it passes the senate will almost certainly follow suit if it fails the upper chamber does not have to act the stakes are enormous for the political credibility of president bill clinton early in his term and for the legacy of president carlos salinas as he nears the end of his for the evolution of the mexican and us economies and for a global trading structure in which a uruguay round agreement scheduled to be reached by december may be unattainable if nafta goes down conventional party lines are irrelevant in the intense retail political war now going on in pursuit of the vote nirvana more republicans perhaps as many as according to congressman jim kolbe of arizona far fewer according to mr jim jontz a former congressman from indiana will vote for than against not least because the original nafta was negotiated by the bush administration this leaves mr clinton needing at most per cent of his own party to triumph and therein lies the problem for the democratic coalition that just by one vote sustained the president in the great budget battle against unanimous republican opposition is in tatters in july it was the new democrats especially moderates from the south who deserted mr clinton while the old liners labour liberals blacks held their noses and held fast on nafta the positions are in good measure reversed according to ms lori wallach a leading co ordinator of the anti campaign the no camp already numbers including some leaners bill daley drafted from his chicago domain to direct the yes campaign disputes this estimate counts about in favour and says that some democrats are still undecided mr jontz disagrees reckoning there are now more republicans than democrats on the fence he thinks the freshman class democrats and republicans is particularly resistant to nafta both sides hail and blast each new convert democrat john dingell of michigan came out for the noes this week but mr daley counters that he could never understand why anybody thought he would do anything different ms wallach is equally dismissive of the impact of the yes declarations of democrats joe kennedy from massachusetts and esteban torres from california the latter she insists probably could not carry the member hispanic caucus the politics of nafta have produced uneasy dalliances among political heavyweights in one bed lie the president the republican leadership including newt gingrich a fervent conservative the senate majority leader the speaker of the house most leaders of big business and some prominent environmental groups in the other can be found the house majority leader lrb richard gephardt rrb and most of the democratic house whips including david bonior of michigan the chief anti nafta strategist plus ralph nader the consumer advocate most of the labour unions pat buchanan the right wing ideologue and ross perot last year s independent presidential candidate ms wallach who portrays the nafta divide as one between populists and the elites says there is little top level contact with mr perot who first spoke of the giant sucking sound of us jobs going south to mexico but that his troops offer access to conservatives and small businesses mr daley says that perot s credibility is diminishing because he has become a politician an assessment borne out by several recent opinion polls both sides agree that the role played by president clinton himself is crucial he is my number one worry never underestimate the power of the presidency says ms wallach he got off to a slow start in the summer he was consumed by the budget and more recently distracted by healthcare haiti and somalia meanwhile the opposition was off and running early the administration pinned a lot of its midsummer hopes on nafta s side agreements covering mexican environmental and labour laws and guarding against import surges meeting most objections but these were only completed in mid august later than planned and were only partly successful six prominent us environmental groups came out in favour but union opposition became entrenched most important congressman gephardt whose backing could probably have ensured passage declared he was not satisfied mr daley insists it does not matter that the president started late because in politics decisions are only taken in the last few days whatever the merits of this argument there is no questioning that the pro nafta campaign is now in full swing with plans that mr clinton himself do little other than argue for the agreement in the next two weeks every day brings a new media show last week saw products day on the white house lawn a display of goods that would benefit from nafta last weekend the president went to boston to maintain that jfk would have been pro nafta on monday he appeared at an electronic town meeting with members of the american chamber of commerce later this week he is in louisville kentucky on sunday an hour long tv interview is scheduled about twice a week he has congressmen in his office for a nafta exhortation he works the phones constantly and all members of his cabinet are fully engaged sometimes inventively mr kantor s latest pitch is that japan is against nafta and would along with europe seek to profit from its defeat the nafta war room operating out of the old executive office building next to the white house co ordinates it all and makes sure that businessmen keep up the pressure on individual members certain actions both substantive and personal get taken with nafta in view last week s creation of the north american development bank with its funds available for border clean up obviously helped congressman torres come off the fence at the other extreme congressman e clay shaw a florida republican is demanding that the administration put pressure on mexico for the extradition of an accused rapist mr daley says we have made our views known to the mexican government on this though they knew about it already all this activity is matched with fervour and skill by the other side ms wallach claims to have kept a lid on vote switching she points out that congressman kweisi mfume from maryland leader of the strong black democratic caucus previously so loyal to mr clinton is helping mr bonior garner votes against nafta and that only one black congressman has come out in favour on broader policy issues both camps were bombarding the media with their respective spins after last week s canadian election result they ve thrown everything at us but it has n t made a difference so far she insists with two weeks to go neither side will publicly admit the possibility of defeat mr daley says he will not sell the white house lawn but seen crossing it yesterday was a gaggle of living nobel laureates including henry kissinger last seen being nice to mr clinton on martha s vineyard in august the grass seemed in place
