nevertheless after at least false starts since the project to join england to europe is irreversibly under way this attempt which began life on feb at canterbury with the signing of the tunnel treaty by margaret thatcher and francois mitterrand lrb whose rolls royce reportedly was met with flying eggs and chants of froggy froggy froggy out out out rrb promises to be completed and open for business by june the british terminal may be seen or at least imagined below a ledge of dewy grass near dover dotted with poppies and daisies with church spires in one direction and the white cliffs in another slow tractors are piling up walls of earth cranes and pulleys hoist slabs of cast concrete through a jungle of rusting iron armatures it looks like child s play until you spot the men in hard hats tiny beside their mechanical dinosaurs they are the toys in the sandbox later i get close to the toy chest the construction camp in the shadow of shakespeare cliff where nearly of them live farthingloe village a new concept in community living consists of featureless blocks spike topped fencing floodlights security guards and warnings that all personnel may be searched on leaving the premises residents pay or a week but the men staying here most of them migrant laborers from ireland and northern england are rumored to earn as much as a week inside the tunnel it is cold and wet and dark but mainly it s big we few journalists looking weedy as hell clutching our notebooks trudge along in borrowed boots on a guided tour past some very large men lrb inwardly i take back all i thought from the safety of the dewy green poppy sprayed ledge about toys rrb the site manager gives us the big figures the total length of each tunnel will be miles of which will be under the sea seven thousand british and french workers on eight to hour shifts have completed more than half of the job of the three tunnels two big ones for trains and another for service the smallest is the most advanced they ve bored more than miles the breakthrough is expected by november the boring machines are fantastic guided by satellite gyroscope computer and laser these monsters equipped with cuisinart style blades more than feet wide can chop and shred chalk at about feet an hour or feet a week we only hear of other machines such as a giant pump in a foot shaft that sucks the spoil slurry out of the tunnel but we get some more big figures for the notebooks two thousand tons of spoil come out every hour tons of material go in money the press here reports is being spent at a rate of million a day the treaty which contains a clause prohibiting government subsidies for the tunnel gave a year concession to eurotunnel an anglo french partnership that commissioned trans manche link a consortium of five english contractors lrb costain wimpey taylor woodrow balfour beatty and tarmac rrb and five french lrb boygues dumez societe generale d entreprise societe auxiliaire d entreprises spie batignolles rrb to design and build the tunnel the original forecast for the whole project was billion to the chagrin of the banks involved it now has reached billion and many people estimate tunnel costs of billion before we see the light at the end all this for mad dogs and frenchmen in not quite nineteen ninety two may mean an end to duty free goods but the tunnel will be more than a symbol of european unity it will transport analysts say reinforce historically dominant trading links in the london frankfurt milan so called golden triangle bolstering northern europe as an economic entity at a time when its pre eminence is being challenged by a strengthened mediterranean sunbelt stretching from barcelona to trieste and by new opportunities to the east and for the rest of us it will mean that you can climb aboard and whiz from london to paris in three hours there also is however a missing link all leaders like to leave their monuments for mr mitterrand with his pyramid and his own triumphal arch the chunnel is a new shape for the collection for mrs thatcher in her way a choreographer or a sculptor the monument may be seen in terms of negative space the tunnel is perhaps her final proof that britain s victorian glory can be recaptured without spending a penny of public money in the same week that the french government revealed its plans to spend billion francs lrb billion rrb on expanding its high speed rail network the prime minister announced that there will be no government subsidy for a fast train between london and the tunnel in effect shelving plans for a much discussed new mile link between london and folkestone many observers believe that by doing nothing to improve the nation s creaking rail system britain will lose out on the full benefits of the chunnel lrb britain is about to enter the st century with the worst transport infrastructure in northern europe john banham the director general of the confederation of british industry said recently we will become the butt of french jokes and be economically marginalized in europe rrb and travelers from france will have to adjust perhaps by chewing gum rapidly when they switch from the grande vitesse of the chemins de fer francais to the homely milk route of british rail and sit out an extra half hour until arrival at waterloo this though is not a matter of time or money it s an attitude problem while the number of french shareholders in the project has risen from to the number of british investors has remained at and while kent residents marched on westminster in protest against the desecration of their villages there was keen competition among french towns to have the new fast train service run through their region despite the gift packs of french and english wine lrb more unfavorable comparisons rrb on sale just beneath the i dig the tunnel stickers at the eurotunnel exhibition centre most britons seem to share or will have to learn to live in regretful memory of gladstone s view that england should be happy that the wise dispensation of providence has cut her off by that streak of silver sea partly from dangers absolutely from the temptations which attend
