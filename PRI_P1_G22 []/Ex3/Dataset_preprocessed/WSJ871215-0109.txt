how much more of an investment should american taxpayers make in the welfare system this is the question the house of representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the family welfare reform act of the bill proposes billion in new spending over five years and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients it appears that what we have here is something of a trojan horse a piece of legislation that is represented as reform when all it does is expand existing welfare programs the bill s questionable premise is that larger expenditures on welfare will reduce welfare dependency this thinking was nicely summarized by rep anthony beilenson who said plainly the truth is for welfare reform to be successful it s got to be expensive the proposed new spending on welfare should be viewed as an investment say its proponents led by rep thomas downey they point out that part of the money will go for special education training and work programs for welfare mothers to induce them off the rolls and into jobs at the same time they say certain existing benefits mainly aid to families with dependent children lrb afdc rrb must be increased to offset real declines since the base year of house members on both sides of the aisle agree that welfare to work programs are worthwhile that conclusion was presumably the basis for the bipartisan consensus that was going to produce a serious welfare reform bill this year but less than a quarter of the billion outlay would go for that purpose the bulk of the new money would go to higher afdc pay outs extension of mandatory benefits to two parent families and maintenance of certain benefits for welfare recipients earning some income in short the family welfare reform act amounts to an expanded investment in the status quo of course house democrats could hardly promote this bill as more of the same that might produce reprisals from voters who ve watched their tax dollars build and maintain the welfare system with little evident return on their investment instead after nearly years the system s defenders and funders repeatedly tell the public that the problem if anything has gotten worse so the house s liberal majority hoped to achieve an increase in welfare outlays by making a bow to reform in fact while the level of afdc benefits has decreased in real terms since the total level of all welfare benefits has not nearly all afdc families also receive medicaid coverage for instance more than three quarters receive food stamps and one third have children who receive free school meals one quarter receive housing assistance together spending for the seven major welfare programs lrb those just mentioned plus the women infants and children program and the low income energy assistance program rrb has actually increased since by in constant dollars to an annual total billion the house democrats claim that welfare recipients are worse off than they were in in terms of the level of benefits received is dubious measured in the terms that really count namely the number of welfare dependents liberated from the rolls the situation has become worse during the unprecedented expansion of the welfare state the most notable and highly publicized phenomenon has been the development of an entrenched class of long term welfare dependents it is difficult to accept that the billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the family welfare reform act will do much of anything about the problem of hard core welfare dependency at the least welfare reform should have these goals to shrink rather than enlarge the welfare system to ultimately eliminate perverse incentives to remain on welfare and to make work the focus of the system the house bill does n t do that by adding several welfare programs to what already exists lrb without eliminating any rrb the house bill adds another layer to an already complex welfare system by further increasing rather than gradually reducing the level of benefits available to recipients it makes welfare more not less enticing by diluting proposed work for welfare requirements it diminishes the importance of work earlier this year there were hopeful signs that we would see sweeping serious welfare reform legislation emerge from congress democrats and republicans alike agreed on the need for change this rare opportunity is being squandered
