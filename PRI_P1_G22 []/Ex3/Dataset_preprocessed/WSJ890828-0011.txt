though the forms for the census are already at the printers congress is contemplating adding a question are you an illegal immigrant the census bureau as it has in the past is planning to count all residents of the nation regardless of legal status but the senate already has voted to force the census bureau to exclude illegal immigrants in preparing tallies for congressional reapportionment a majority of the members of the house of representatives has signaled support it is wrong to apportion congressional seats by counting people who would be deported if our immigration laws were enforced rep thomas petri lrb r wis rrb said in a recent house debate replied rep jim kolbe lrb r ariz rrb a very clear reading of the constitution says that we shall count all those who are present although the debate is often couched in constitutional arguments it s largely driven by geography wisconsin has few illegal immigrants arizona has lots it boils down to regional politics says arturo vargas census program director for the mexican american legal defense and educational fund one of several hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants counting illegal immigrants in is likely to mean one less seat in the house for pennsylvania and one more for california according to the private population reference bureau the census bureau s chief antagonist in the senate sen richard shelby lrb d ala rrb says seats for connecticut michigan north carolina and alabama also are at risk on the other hand texas florida and new york could benefit illegal aliens are actually taking representation away from americans says david ray spokesman for the federation for american immigration reform the census bureau based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the immigration and naturalization service estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in half of them in california that meant one extra seat in the house for california and new york and one less seat for indiana and georgia you end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals says rep thomas ridge lrb r pa rrb who leads the charge against the practice in the house organizations that represent hispanics are particularly worried about the congressional campaign they fear that any attempt to ascertain the legal status of respondents will exacerbate difficulties the census bureau already faces in accurately counting hispanics and blacks as it is the census bureau has a tremendous challenge in trying to convince everybody that the census is confidential mr vargas says if the census bureau attempts to ask people their immigration status that s going to be even harder the census bureau agrees we tell people put your name down on the census form we wo n t report you to the housing authority lcb if there are too many occupants rcb says peter bonpanne an assistant director if they see a lot of questions on there about somebody s legal status that could hurt all kinds of people s participation although the million census forms can be reprinted if congress acts soon wording a question so that illegal immigrants answer accurately is a challenge mr bonpanne says the bureau already plans to ask one in six respondents if they are citizens to satisfy congressional critics it would have to ask everyone that question and then ask the legal status of anyone who is n t a citizen rep ridge dismisses the practical problems we re spending billions on the census and the only thing we get is a bunch of belly aching about how difficult it will be he complains the primary purpose of the census is to distribute political power not to gather demographic information the senate by a vote of added a provision to a pending immigration bill to require the government to subtract illegal immigrants when it comes up with figures used for reapportionment because california texas and other populous states that benefit from counting the illegal immigrants have such large delegations in the house the house has always presented a bigger obstacle to the opponents of counting such immigrants the house did open the door to an amendment to a spending bill that would have barred census takers from knowingly counting any illegal immigrants but the provision was quickly sidetracked on procedural grounds all sides in the debate predict a lawsuit no matter what congress does in a federal appeals court upheld a lower court decision throwing out a suit that sought to bar the government from counting illegal immigrants a similar suit was dismissed this year when a federal district judge in pittsburgh ruled that the states that sued pennsylvania kansas and alabama could n t show they had been harmed the constitution simply calls for apportioning the house on the basis of the the whole number of persons in each state the constitution originally called for counting free persons and indentured servants and for counting slaves as three fifths of a person that was changed with the passage of the th amendment in only indians not taxed were excluded but no one has fallen into that category since much of the argument in congress turns on the use of the word person in references to the census elsewhere in the constitution the framers used the word citizen they wrote for instance that only those who have been seven years a citizen of the united states can serve in the house the word person was repeated in the th amendment which was drafted after the civil war those in congress and at the census bureau who favor continuing the practice of counting all residents of the u s conclude that this language unambiguously resolves the debate their opponents say the drafters of the constitution and the th amendment never even considered the concept of an illegal immigrant let alone contemplated their current numbers estimates of illegal aliens counted in census total u s california new york texas illinois
