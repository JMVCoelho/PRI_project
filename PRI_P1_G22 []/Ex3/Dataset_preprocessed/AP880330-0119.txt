if the two sides trying to force changes in the census both get their way the results would nearly balance one another a population expert said wednesday the census bureau is under pressure to exclude illegal aliens from its national head count traditionally it counts everyone living in the country groups which have filed suit to ignore the aliens contend large concentrations of them could result in in some states gaining seats in the house of representatives at the expense of other states meanwhile other groups want the final census totals to be increased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census _ most often blacks and hispanics living in urban areas at stake are the seats in the house which are distributed among the states on the basis of population if both sides get their way the only change would be a flip flop of one seat from california to georgia said william o hare director of policy studies for the independent population reference bureau o hare told a breakfast briefing for northeast and midwest members of congress that he estimates their region will lose house seats following the census that would continue a trend evident over the last several decades he noted using estimates of the number of illegal aliens and undercounted minorities he said that deleting the one group and adding in the other would make little difference in the long run the only change he said would be that california would gain five new seats instead of six while georgia would add two rather than just one that s easy to understand since there are so many undocumented aliens in california he commented o hare s study of potential changes in house seats _ based on projections with no adjustments _ calls for california to be the big gainer adding six house seats followed by florida with a gain of four and texas adding three expected to pick up one seat each are virginia north carolina georgia and arizona on the other hand new york would lose three seats states losing two apiece would be pennsylvania ohio illinois and michigan expected to lose one house seat are massachusetts wisconsin iowa kansas west virginia and montana
