the jwaneng mine on the fringes of the kalahari desert in botswana is known as a gem in the world of gems because it almost certainly is the richest diamond mine in the world at least in terms of the value of the stones it yields jwaneng s position is being reinforced by a usdollars m expansion programme at present being completed three months ahead of schedule and under budget meanwhile km west of kimberley in the northern cape province of south africa another diamond mine the finsch where operations started in has been given a new lease of life having dug an open pit metres deep miners have now gone underground mr simon webb the general manager says that the underground development has given it another to years of life all this goes to show that de beers the south african group that dominates world trade in rough lrb uncut rrb diamonds still has complete faith in its ability to maintain stability in the diamond market despite short term difficulties such as those the company is experiencing with russia it also remains intent on maintaining its diamond output even though its year old mines at kimberley are now running down the south african group believes that its control of at least per cent of world diamond production gives it a powerful base from which to negotiate with the other producers who have marketing contracts with de beers central selling organisation in botswana de beers controls half of debswana the company that owns the jwaneng mine with the government owning the rest the value of jwaneng to botswana can not be overstated it and the country s two other lrb smaller rrb diamond mines between them account for per cent of the government s revenue and per cent of the country s gross domestic product no wonder jwaneng s company slogan is re phtas imisa botswana which translates as we make botswana sparkle production started at jwaneng in now a so called fourth stream is being completed which is adding one third to processing capacity in turn this means a per cent rise in the number of carats produced last year the mine treated m tonnes of ore which yielded m carats of diamonds well below the output when the m tonnes treated gave up more than m carats jwaneng s open pit has reached a depth of metres already it is kms long and km wide mr loz shaw chief geologist says drilling down to metres shows there are still plenty of diamonds at that depth and so the pit will go down at least that far mr derrick moore the general manager says this indicates mining in the open pit will last another years and then we might go underground if experience at de beers wholly owned finsch mine in south africa is anything to go by planning the underground development at jwaneng might already have started planning for the underground mine at finsch started in the s and the first work began in yet the bottom of the finsch open pit metres was not reached until unfortunately things did not go completely as expected when underground mining started to some extent because the development was designed by a management whose expertise was mainly in open pit mining however mr mark button mining superintendent says finsch has come of age as an underground mine after two years our costs compare with the best in the group among the innovations that have helped finsch achieve its objectives are some remote controlled lhd lrb load haul dump rrb trucks which are similar to radio controlled toy vehicles or boats using vhf radio signals a driver can stand back and send a truck on its own to dig out material from areas between the old pit wall and the underground development that would not otherwise be mined because of the dangers involved when as occasionally happens rock crashes on to the lhd trucks it is relatively simply to haul the vehicles out virtually undamaged mr webb says the objective is to mine down to a depth of metres at which point there are not enough diamonds left in the ground to make recovery viable finsch named after the discoverers messrs fincham and schwabel who stumbled across the kimberlite pipe containing the diamonds when actually they were looking for asbestos is one of the victims of the present turmoil in the diamond market caused mainly by uncertainties about russian exports about of its employees were laid off in august it is mining only five days a week at present and processing on four days last year finsch mined m tonnes and recovered m carats of diamonds compared with m tonnes mined and m carats in mr webb suggests output will be similar to last year s but when market conditions improve production can be brought back up to previous levels in about six months
