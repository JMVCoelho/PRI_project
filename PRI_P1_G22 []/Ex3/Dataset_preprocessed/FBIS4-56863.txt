stating that it is an international communist rule that no leader can lead lrb the party or a war rrb from prison according to the maoist theory a militant who is in prison loses his operational

according to an intelligence report datelined march that states it was held in razuhuillca huanta province ayacucho as a result peruvian air force troops carried out operations in the aforementioned

start a new phase of the people s war as well as plan an operation to rescue abimael guzman dead or alive at any cost the five point document issued at the end of the meeting is attached to lengthy citations of speeches by abimael guzman and documents signed by him that show why the war must not end the following is one of the citations chosen by the shining path central committee to uphold its decisions always taking into account the glorious actions of the people s war the people s war can not end the leadership may be wiped out completely or partially but those leaders who are not must and can continue carrying out plans the struggle the people s war we were taught that the revolution will not stop will not become paralyzed this was selected from the document entitled to conquer power in the midst of the people s war that was drafted during the second shining path central committee plenum when guzman was still free the document even mentions what must be done with those who uphold peace and put down arms there are two reasons for surrendering to surrender in view of local reaction and to surrender in view of international reaction this is always the case its purpose is to ruin the revolution those who surrender therefore are no good and must be wiped out through fire and bloodshed lrb preliminary session of the second plenum rrb the first of the five points discussed during the meeting refers to reasserting the agreements reached during the third central committee plenum which was held in march and headed by abimael guzman reinoso this plenum was labeled glorious historic and momentous as it planned the terrible wave of violence unleashed by the shining path in july during the partisan meeting it was stated that during an adverse situation the party should draft a new plan taking into account the experience of the past years establish new axes sub axes guidelines and lines of action with a nationwide criteria lrb rrb seek new ways to develop and set up strategic military plans and establish for example those objectives and carry them out on an established date it seems that the third central committee plenum s assessment of what was happening to the shining path was negative and therefore it was decided to unleash a fierce wave of violence in order to conceal the weaknesses of the maoist organization the second point of the document of the central committee meeting presided over by feliciano highlights the agreements of the working meeting of the shining path leadership held in august almost one year after guzman was arrested and during which the implementation of the agreements of the third plenum held in march was discussed during the working meeting and in addition to approving the efforts to step up investigations to determine the sanctions for those who are found responsible for contributing to the arrest of abimael guzman it was agreed among other issues to defend the life of president gonzalo by widely preaching our ideology by showing great courage placing even our lives at stake by keeping our red and invincible flag flying high and by pursuing our unwavering objective communism  to reassert the conclusions of the third central committee plenum lrb march rrb personally presided over by president gonzalo whose victorious appearance revealed its glorious historic and momentous nature the second most important milestone after the congress lrb held in rrb  to reassert the three strategies the political strategy to conquer power the military strategy the people s war to develop the war of movements and promote arrangements for the uprising of cities and the construction strategy to make arrangements to conquer power in the midst of the people s war based on the conclusions of the third plenum and the working meeting the central committee during the meeting in february presided over by feliciano reasserted the principle of revolutionary violence as a universal law expressed in the people s war the third point discussed during the central committee meeting headed by feliciano referred to the militants who uphold the peace accord the document addresses this aspect of the internal debate as about the struggle against the counterrevolutionary hoax and the black group that upholds a right wing opportunist line lrb lod rrb in order to confront the black group or lod which are nothing but shining path militants who sign abimael guzman s letters and uphold his great decision and definition to negotiate with the government in order to end the war the central committee demands that the militants grow stronger on the basis for partisan unity lsb base de unidad partidaria bup rsb which is the shining path basic principles adopted during the congress and arrange for conquering power in the midst of the people s war the central committee plenum that feliciano presided over in order to break away from the black group orders the unleashing of a massive reassertion movement based on the bup throughout the party the people s liberation army and among the masses of the new power the central committee uses several arguments to urge the smashing of the counterrevolutionary nonsense and the misbegotten schemes of yankee imperialism the genocidal and traitorous dictatorship and the black group the agreements reached at the third plenum lrb march rrb and the working meeting lrb august rrb must be ratified because facts have confirmed that the position established on those occasions toward the counterrevolutionary scheme was right and proper  abimael guzman s letters to president alberto fujimori the telephone conversation between guzman and javier esparza marquez lrb guzman s brother in law who is in charge of shining path s organization abroad rrb and the communiques released by shining path prisoners are a counterrevolutionary scheme concocted by yankee imperialists and the genocidal and traitorous dictatorship with the sinister help of the black group the central committee concluded at its february meeting it added the short term objective of this scheme is to win the elections prevent the commemoration of lrb mao s rrb centennial in december and cover up the la cantuta affair but the final goal is to annihilate the people s war and move ahead with their plan to murder president gonzalo the central committee does acknowledge guzman as its leader and gives him credit for the ideology he devised the so called gonzalo s thoughts but now he is considered to be a merely decorative figure because neither the party nor the war can be led from a cell especially when the leader is kept incommunicado and his contacts with the outside world must go through government officials  the black group is made up of infiltrators traitors weaklings and old revisionists linked directly to reactionaries meaning osman morote elena iparraguire maria pantoja martha huatay edmundo cox and others who are in touch with government representatives and prison officials  the activities of the black group go against the conclusions of the marxist leninist maoist gonzalo s thoughts first congress lrb rrb the bup the leadership the party and the people s war which means that its members have voluntarily strayed from the party this clearly means that the negotiators of the peace agreement no longer belong to the shining path because their actions openly violate the agreements resolutions and decisions reached at party meetings such as the third plenum and the working meeting thus they do not represent the ideology of the peruvian communist party shining path furthermore actions that go against principles can not be accepted because it is an international communist rule that the leadership lrb of the party and the war rrb can not be exercised from prison and because monstrosities like the peace accord lrb rrb clash with our principles the central committee meeting that feliciano presided over clearly defined its position toward abimael guzman reinoso whose ideological contribution to the people s war called gonzalo s thoughts was acknowledged gonzalo s leadership was also accepted but as he is operationally restricted he can not lead the party anymore guzman and the leaders who support his decision to hold talks with the administration signed a communique that was released in march this communique warned against and denounced the reports of feliciano s central committee which decided to go on with the war this communique stated they are trying to separate gonzalo s thoughts from president gonzalo the person under the guise of defending the party they are undermining it and its leadership so as to bring about its defeat by using empty rhetoric to disguise their partisan opportunistic and personal interests and ambitions and by taking a blind biased subjective and superficial approach to concrete reality lrb rrb we urge the eradication of these leftist ideas of military extraction the communique emphasized the decision to put an end to the people s war the people s war is over to continue it means sabotaging the peace agreement we warn our members against militaristic and revisionist approaches and urge them to keep their eyes open to unmask this or any other scheme guzman s call upon the militants in action to abide by the decision to hold talks with the administration in order to stop the war and to fight those who disagree with this decision is persistent once again we warn the militants to be on guard against any desperate action adventure or provocation from third parties because the goal of all this is to scuttle the proposed peace agreement such actions must be prevented to the extent possible and immediately and categorically criticized meanwhile the central committee has acknowledged gonzalo s thoughts as the ideological basis for the people s war guzman reinoso s leadership and his inability to lead the party and the war from prison and has decided to reorganize the shining path machine to launch a new stage of the war without guzman the dincote report lists the steps that feliciano s followers are taking to carry out actions that would put shining path back in the political picture the report states that the shining path is expected to carry out isolated actions at key targets in order to demonstrate its operational capacity intelligence agents believe that the most likely targets are financial companies banks stores and industries in order to sow confusion among local and foreign investors other likely targets are soon to be privatized public energy and mining companies the embassies of countries whose citizens are purchasing peruvian companies and the interests that these countries already have in peru government politicians and high ranking members of the forces of order are also among the main targets in this case the objective is to obtain the freedom of abimael guzman reinoso the counterterrorism police believe that the shining path urgently needs to demonstrate its power in order to get out of its current defensive position dincote s intelligence reports adds that the internal strife in the shining path has reached the level of killings among militants so it is likely that there will be a settling of accounts shining path members believe that surrender deserves capital punishment the dincote report which confirmed that feliciano presided over a shining path central committee meeting somewhere in razuillca added that it has been decided to rescue abimael guzman reinoso dead or alive the report explains that israeli experts in hostage rescue and underwater operations lrb demolition rrb have been hired for this purpose the shining path also considered the possibility of winning over peruvian security forces personnel so as to attract new members including armed forces special operations personnel the page police report labeled dincote em lima provides a detailed analysis of the behavior of the shining path and the tupac amaru revolutionary movement throughout the country according to feliciano and his followers guzman reinoso has fallen prey to a plot designed to murder him feliciano claims that the forged letters sent to president alberto fujimori the communiques supporting the peace agreement signed by shining path prisoners in canto grande chorrillos and yanamayo and the statements and gestures of osman morote bariionuevo and edmundo cox beuzeville are all part of this plot as far as feliciano is concerned rescuing guzman reinoso dead or alive is just a symbolic gesture in any case
