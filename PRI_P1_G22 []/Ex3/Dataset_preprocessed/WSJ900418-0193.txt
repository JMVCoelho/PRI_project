the root of the problems with congress is that barring major scandal it is almost impossible to defeat an incumbent in the past three elections or more of house incumbents who ran won this lack of turnover has resulted in legislative arrogance a dearth of new ideas and unaccountability congress just violated its legal budget deadline where are the special prosecutors franking privileges huge staffs gerrymandering and unfair campaign finance laws have combined to give incumbents a grossly unfair advantage one out of four house districts this year likely will have an incumbent running with no major party opposition up from one out of five in one candidate races are now spreading to the senate democratic arkansas senator david pryor had spirited competition in when he won with this year he has no opponent at all senators have become just as brazen as their house brethren in shutting out competition take republican senator larry pressler s latest mailing to south dakotans it contains five pictures of the senator and mentions his name times on four pages last year mr pressler sent out more than million pieces of mail the equivalent of pieces per household critics of term limits say that franked mail or not it s wrong to blame congress for the now nearly re election rates since it is just as easy to vote against an incumbent as for michael kinsley writes in the new republic that if incumbents always win it s because voters ca n t be bothered this presumes that voters can find out who the other candidate is it is a political axiom that people wo n t vote for someone they know nothing about that takes money and skewed campaign finance laws combined with taxpayer paid junk mail effectively mean that only incumbents have the cash to make themselves known and to be taken seriously by the media incumbents ended the elections with million left over while challengers were able to raise and spend a total of only million some complain that limiting terms would infringe on democracy by not allowing voters to elect whom they please the polls indicate voters by two to one think the only way they can control congress effectively is by limiting terms we also note that these critics are not agitating in support of ronald reagan s call for repeal of the two term limit for presidents a big problem of the current system limiting presidents but not congress is that this means political power is constantly tipped in favor of the legislative branch getting incumbents to reduce the advantages they have voted themselves is something like asking banks to leave their vaults unlocked that s why the washington d c based americans to limit congressional terms is asking states to call for a constitutional amendment to limit terms it already has won in utah and south dakota this fall the group will try to get both incumbents and challengers to pledge they will not serve more than years in office self imposed limits on office holding were once part of this country s public service ethic with members returning to private life after a couple of terms as late as the average length of house service was four years the number of freshmen in a new house never dipped below until in the current house it is term limitation once the accepted american tradition has been replaced by congressional careerism the opinion polls for term limitation show that the voters do n t like the change they now think the voluntary service limitation of the past must be made mandatory curbing the incumbents do you think there should be a limit to the number of times a member of the house of representatives can be elected to a two year term or not favor oppose total sample by party republicans democrats by philosophy ideology liberal moderate conservative by presidential preference voters pro bush voters anti bush by race white black by gender men women source new york times cbs news poll survey of adults conducted march april with a margin of error
