mother nature conspired against this struggling marathon sunday serving up balmy windy weather and wilting both the men s and women s fields temperatures during the old style chicago marathon hovered in the mid s with humidity the heat sapped the strength of most runners giving the patient and steady runners a distinct advantage among the men paul davies hale of england proved the most patient winning in a rather pedestrian hours minutes seconds in his first marathon ever it was the slowest winning time in this race since among the women lisa weidenbach of issaquah wash repeated as champion with a personal best of impressive under the circumstances it was the second hottest race in chicago history only was worse by comparison last year s race was degrees cooler at the start most distance runners prefer temperatures in the s with cloud cover the race conditions were simply more bad luck for the th running of chicago s marathon which has been fighting for respectability since losing its sponsor in and staging no race in after a week of summer like weather race organizers hoped to be salvaged by a good race to have if not impressive times on this flat and fast course at least a memorable race that developed at points sunday as about runners started at daley plaza downtown and wended their way through city streets a pack of five men took off fast maintaining a pace at nine miles those early leaders el mostafa nechchadi of morocco don janicki of colorado gerardo alcala of mexico carlos montero of spain and gabriel kamau of kenya they did the early work against the wind while a second pack hovered seconds behind the lead pack went through the half marathon at a pace that would wither in the second half no one who was in the lead pack at the halfway point with the exception of montero finished in the top five davies hale had been among those who had cagily stayed back going with a more conservative approach i was concentrating on running five minute miles he said he accomplished that almost exactly his time works out to mile splits davies hale caught the second pack at miles and met up with pre race favorite steve binns who lives miles from davies hale in england s west midlands the two quickly went in different directions binns falling back lrb he eventually dropped out rrb and davies hale moving up i asked binnsie who was in the first group he told me and i went davies hale said at miles davies hale was in the lead and in control running smoothly and not appearing to labor under the bright sun following him and likewise picking off the fading runners in the first pack were ravil kashapov of the soviet union who was second in and david long also from the british midlands who was third in ed eyestone was the first u s finisher in fourth in the women s race weidenbach had not been the favorite and she agreed with that handicapping to be honest with you i was afraid of cathy lrb o brien rrb she said with reason o brien a year old from boston has been on the verge of a breakthrough for a long time she took off in sunday s race with authority and ran with a second cushion for miles then the heat from the sun and the perceptible heat of weidenbach constantly gaining did her in at miles weidenbach came up on o brien her new balance teammate they shared some water then weidenbach tossed aside the water bottle and put on a surge that left o brien flat it was the same spot the corner of wells and north avenue that weidenbach had taken the lead in last year s race it was also where dozens of her family members and friends were posted carla beurskens of the netherlands at still an amazing runner eventually passed the struggling o brien and placed second o brien was third in given the heat the humidity and the wind weidenbach s time might have been as much as two minutes faster even the is respectable only five u s women have run under i guess when you are having a good day nothing is going to get you down she said davies hale a former plumber from rugeley straffordshire seemed bemused by the attention and nonplussed that he had just won in prize money about as far as he seemed willing to go on the celebrity scale was to say he had pitched the plumbing job i ll still do the odd washing machine good rates he said davies hale came to the united states in and settled in boulder colo the nation s unofficial running center davies hale may have shown a liking for running in heat when he won the boulder bolder that year in terrific heat he was a olympian in the steeplechase and on the advice of others moved up to and meters still davies hale is unsure what his future in the marathon is like his fellow countrymen he s low key and practical and not interested in speculating i ve already had a great track season davies hale said i may run another marathon next year but i really want to get back on the track marathon notes race organizers insist that this race is at a world class level especially pointing to the world s richest purse that may be so but all major marathons have drug testing and chicago has none race director tim murphy said the race was not selected by the athletics congress which governs the sport to conduct testing men s and women s winners won second place won and third place scot hellebuyck won the men s wheelchair race in ann cody morris won the women s wheelchair race in
