now in the wake of that firestorm local firefighters are looking up at the hills that surround this area and wondering not whether but only when and where i know it s there said saratoga fire chief ernest kraule every fire chief there s of us in this county knows it s there the danger is in the saratoga foothills where kraule s department has battled nine deliberately set fires since june most recently oct the same day oakland firefighters thought they had contained a brush fire that a day later blossomed into the deadly firestorm it s in the mountain communities that straddle highway in santa cruz county isolated by weak bridges that wo n t support some firetrucks and connected by a two lane road that will hinder escape it s in los altos hills where residents in repealed an ordinance requiring fire retardant roofs a year later a fire destroyed acres and homes many of which have been rebuilt with the same flammable shake roofs in fact the danger of an oakland like inferno is in almost all of the hills that ring the south bay where homes often are surrounded by dense brush or stately trees the fuel of rapidly spreading wildfires and the risk is increasing as cramped bay area residents push farther into the hills and canyons in search of living space and rural atmosphere state officials say it s no coincidence that six of california s most damaging wildfires have occurred since the tendency is to have bigger fires that are much more expensive to put out with much more property loss said roy pike a deputy chief in the california department of forestry and fire protection s santa rosa office privacy s high price having pushed into these areas city dwellers do n t understand that the wooded seclusion and natural beauty exact a cost in fire protection rescue workers complain in cities a firetruck might respond to an alarm within two or three minutes in the highway communities they hope for minutes instead of an eight or inch water main ensuring pressure for fire hoses the mountains are laced with two inch pipes those are the risks you take when you live in an area like this said dean lucke chief of the forestry department s san mateo santa cruz ranger unit we ca n t guarantee everyone s safety up here at all times in general firefighters say the heavily wooded santa cruz mountains are more susceptible to major fires than the grass covered eastern foothills take the fire above lexington reservoir which blazed for six days scorching nearly acres and destroying homes but there are exceptions such as narrow kilkare canyon near sunol where homes are strung along a narrow five mile dead end road that empties onto narrow winding niles canyon road a large concentration of vegetation heavy fuel loads lots of wooden structures ingress egress lrb problems rrb lack of water they re all there said fremont fire chief dan lydon whose department would be one of the first called to a fire in kilkare if there s an area that has the significant potential for disaster that s one codes rarely enforced in the hills nearly every home is surrounded by thick brush or dense woods fire codes require residents to keep the trees feet from their homes but fire officials admit they rarely enforce them instead as they drive by some firefighters make mental notes about which homes would be worth saving you do this evaluation of what you think you d be effective at salvaging said don shaw a battalion chief for the palo alto fire department by not trimming dense brush he said some homeowners are virtually signing a death warrant and increasingly fire officials worry about wildfires spreading into even more heavily populated areas at the base of the foothills where numerous trees create an urban forest we could have a fire going from rooftop to treetop to rooftop to treetop in any number of areas in this city if the weather conditions are right said san jose fire chief robert osby the lesson of the oakland hills firefighters say is to contain and extinguish even the smallest fires as quickly as possible but often that means firefighters have to overcome narrow roads weak bridges inadequate water pressure and gridlock from fleeing residents challenge for firefighters many of the south bay s most vulnerable areas such as redwood estates above los gatos and emerald lake hills above redwood city began as colonies of summer homes a handful of secluded cottages strung along narrow winding roads now these communities are the year round home for thousands often still dependent on volunteer firefighters and an overtaxed network of roads and water lines on a good day trying to maneuver fire apparatus on those roads is tough said steve cavallero a battalion chief for the redwood city fire department which covers a portion of emerald lake hills combine that with panic with people getting out of the way and you re setting the stage for disaster an estimated people live in the communities along highway between santa cruz and boulder creek the curvy two lane road that would be the only way out in the case of a major fire how would all those people escape that s a good question said o j burrell chief of fire prevention at the san mateo santa cruz ranger unit weak bridges keep firetrucks out of many of those communities as well as new almaden valley south of san jose forcing firefighters to carry hoses by hand ed ekers chief of the santa cruz city fire department worries about sending his trucks through a tunnel of fire if flames were ever to spread across the canopy of trees above highway will there be water even if they can reach a blaze firefighters know there may not be any water to fight it in oakland water pressure dropped as electricity failures shut off pumps and thousands of open hydrants and water connections quickly drained reservoirs that could happen even in urbanized areas of santa clara county because the major water suppliers rely on a similar system of electric pumps to maintain water pressure in the foothills we would face the same situation said sharon whaley spokeswoman for the san jose water co which serves foothill areas in los gatos saratoga and almaden in rural areas water supplies are even chancier in the east foothills and southern santa clara county homeowners have to provide only gallons for firefighting barely enough for five minutes at the rate some firetrucks pump to mike balesteri chief of the forestry department ranger unit in santa clara county the lesson is simple it s either bring your own water or find your own water in our game taps would go dry quickly even when rural communities have upgraded their water systems as redwood estates did firefighters say the taps would start to run low if three or four houses were burning at once local officials say they try to limit fire hazards largely by restricting development in the hills but many of the most dangerous areas were built long before modern planning ordinances and building codes and for every community like saratoga that requires fire retardant roofs there are others like los altos hills unwilling to suffer even that inconvenience seven years later the los altos hills revolt against fire retardant roofs still resonates in the mind of los altos fire chief dick landrum whose department is charged with protecting the area every time my fire marshal starts to talk about amendments to the building code they say do n t even bring it up landrum said i would hate to say it but i d anticipate another oakland
