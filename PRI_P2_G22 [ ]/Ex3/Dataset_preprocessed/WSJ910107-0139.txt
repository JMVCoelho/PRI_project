thus began another chapter one medicine 's bizarre mysteries , tale sick sheep mad cows , cannibals pennsylvanians , ancient life forms cat named max .plot revolves around family brain diseases , probably variations single disorder , called spongiform encephalopathy .infectious , invariably fatal insidious termites , sometimes eating away brain cells years without detection critical mass spongified ., months , motor control buckles cognition crumbles .victims die quickly , usually within year ., decades detective work , medical sleuths appear closing molecular culprits behind disease .dogged pursuit wo n't nail public-health enemy . 1 -- disease rare -- may pay big way findings could shed light common killers , including alzheimer 's disease .work also promises basic science breakthroughs .spongiform research already raised questions cornerstone biology spawned nobel prize .uncanny nature disorder sometimes grips scientists kind obsessive fascination , notes nih researcher d. carleton gajdusek .know , chased spongiform leads around globe 33 years nobel prize process .recently fascination taken anxious cast disease struck humans animals suspicious regularity several places , underscoring longstanding question : people get disease animals ? question burned special intensity since scrapie , form disease sheep , jumped british cattle years ago fed ground-up parts infected sheep .20,000 british cattle destroyed since 1986 hopes eradicating spongiform `` mad cow `` disease , makes animals jittery keel .weeks ago , first confirmed case mad cow disease outside britain turned switzerland .u.s. meat producers reason anxious incidence scrapie rising american sheep since mid-1980s , says richard marsh , university wisconsin scrapie expert .scientists agree , however , disease animals probably poses little danger people .scrapie existed centuries `` world bathed `` infectious agent , says dr. gajdusek .yet sheep never strongly implicated cases human form disease , creutzfeldt-jakob disease , cjd .least poltar journalist two people died cjd time rural , sheep-herding part eastern czechoslovakia .dr. mitrova , researcher bratislava medical institute , heard unusual cluster cases , decided investigate .first , one clue stood like bloodstain : `` almost people involved raising taking care sheep , `` says .local cuisine includes soup sheep meat stewed sheep milk .area 's equivalent chicken soup colds sheep brain fried onions .one cjd victim even slept pet sheep age 13 .coincidences seem like serial killer 's pattern .odds , cjd struck region , called slovakia -- 69 times since 1975 , mainly grouped two areas .outbreak become something epidemic around orava area , 26 cases occurred since 1987 , rate hundreds times higher normal cjd .residents affected areas `` afraid , `` says dr. mitrova .found evidence scrapie area 's sheep .villagers call cjd `` sheep disease .'' 's leap folklore , though , sheep link may well turn false , cautions dr. mitrova .indeed , cjd nefarious trickster ; first reported case disease , entered medical texts 1920s , really n't cjd , scientists believe .usually strikes rarely randomly -- killing one million people world-wide year -- scientists n't even begin suspect infectious 1957 .year , nih 's dr. gajdusek , young scientist casting big questions , planned trip papua new guinea visit friend .never arrived .en route , heard primitive new guinea tribe , fore , dying droves unknown brain disorder called kuru , `` shivering disease , `` started tremors .fascinated , dropped everything , plunged backwoods local doctor took charge investigating affair , great annoyance australian authorities overseeing area .`` gajdusek ... intelligence quotient 180s emotional immaturity 15-year-old , `` one mentors warned australians letter , `` wo n't let danger , physical difficulty , people 's feelings interfere least wants .'' short , perfect job .soon kuru victims ' brains started issuing heart darkness distant medical centers , compliments dr. gajdusek .swapped axes salt autopsy rights , dissecting one victim carving knife lantern-light native hut howling storm , according letters home .local doctor , vincent zigas , tried everything tranquilizers hormones kuru patients .nothing helped .cause remained elusive .two years later , william hadlow , u.s. veterinarian , saw picture one kuru brains medical journal struck spongy appearance .seen look scrapie , sheep disease , put call nih .another link fell place igor klatzo , nih scientist , noticed kuru brains resembled ones cjd victims .based clues , dr. gajdusek , back nih , led studies 1960s showing kuru , cjd scrapie essentially infectious disease , studies 1976 nobel prize medicine .discoveries confirmed long-suspected connection : kuru outbreak sprang fore mourning ritual , relatives ate deceased kin 's lightly cooked , often kuru-infected , brains .infectious agent continued baffle scientists .somehow could hide brain decades without causing usual signs infection , fever .brain tissue infected animals could transmit disease injected different animals ' brains , yet microscopes revealed signs infectious microbes .agent sporadically appear people known exposure ? seemed like `` biological spontaneous combustion , `` says nih researcher paul brown .early 1980s , scientists discovered cjd , like alzheimer 's disease , often gums brain kind junk , `` amyloid , `` protein .studies showed junk mainly contains botched form naturally occurring brain protein , sometimes called prion .many scientists believe 's culprit .theory entails biologically weird premise : altered protein replicates without aid genetic material , basis known reproduction .'re right , self-replicating proteins might representatives ancient twilight zone life nonlife-evolution 's bridge molecules microbes .formed brain cell , molecule stuff might `` like bad apple barrel converting apples , `` says nih 's dr. brown .hot question : amyloid alzheimer 's disease form similarly ? , however , n't explain happened dr. brown baked isolates disease agent hour 680 degrees fahrenheit , temperature melts proteins .injected ashy residue animals ' brains , expecting nothing happen .got spongiform disease .also buried isolates garden three years found remained infectious .results may `` disquieting , `` says , british farmers , burning burying mad cow corpses .still , dr. brown scientists n't much worried mad cows animal studies show spongiform disease hard transmit orally .eating huge doses agent required .perhaps mad cows got doses `` every time went feedbag , `` says dr. brown .kuru victims apparently consumed similar mega-doses .may max .siamese cat bristol , england , died last spring .examining brain , veterinarian found telltale sponginess , sparking another round panic u.k. spongiform disease .10 british cats died , suggesting brains infected sheep cows got cat food .meanwhile , yet another spongiform outbreak occurred , time among northeastern pennsylvanians .cluster dozen cjd cases `` n't epidemic `` appears topped 1989 , says brian little , allentown neuropathologist leading study .worrisome , like slovakian outbreak , suggests common underlying cause could strike .past months , nih team , working dr. mitrova , found thread first time may link many cjd cases .discovery began scientists ferreted genetic defect two u.s. brothers died cjd ., nothing new .scientists long known cjd runs families therefore suspected genetic problem .dr. brown 's excitement grew three , unrelated cjd victims found carry genetic defect .`` flyer , `` says , `` called relatives victims struck gold .'' eastern european descent , suggesting people similar ancestry might carry gene .drs . brown gajdusek knew look people .grabbed plane czechoslovakia .since , team confirmed many slovakian cjd victims , cluster libyan-born jews whose tissues preserved , carried defect .findings suggest one two things : either defect alone produces deadly agent predisposes carriers get cjd exposed agent .findings opened door early diagnosis possible prevention cjd .also introduced new riddle , says dr. gajdusek : genetic defect , apparently existed decades eastern europeans , turned deadly past 15 years ? `` essentially , 're stuck another paradox , `` adds .`` 's nothing else worth working science .''
